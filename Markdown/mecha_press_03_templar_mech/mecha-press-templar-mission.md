## AS IT HAPPENS:

The Seven Sins discover that the **Beserker** is shown in a private arena fight, setup as a sales pitch to potential buyers. Still hot on the charts, the Seven Sins arrange to be billed against the unknown stable in a *blind match*. According to the agreement, either side can deploy any 'Mech for the fight.

Of course, the Seven Sins know exactly what they are going to fight, and they are armed to do so. Expecting a refitted 3025 'Mech as opposition, the mysterious enemy organization losses the match to the superior **Templar** 'Mech and with it, the **Beserker** prototype.

The remains of the **Beserker** prototype were returned to Defiance Industries and the **Templar** returned to Echo Mirage. FC intelligence unable to arrest anyone in the case. Case closed?

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

The **Templar** is a *maxed out* BattleMech. The design style is based on the Sazabi from the GUNDAM Japanimation series. In fact, it combines so many disparate rules, that it should be *illegal*, but if FASA can build such a **unique** 'Mech, so can we. You'll find the rules relating to the equipment in either the **BattleTech Compendium** or **Unbound**.

Other question you may have, with appropriate answers are:

**Q:** How come the Seven Sins are still together?

**A:** Why cancel something that is so successful? If the GM needs a new StabiliMech, try Ex-Eridani Light Horse Major Michael Bentley, who would graciously accept the position. The stable has the best of 3050 technology and receives *special* equipment **only** when the need arises.

**Q:** Who is this mysterious group that stole the **Beserker** in the first place?

**A:** Wouldn't you know? Ahem, let them call them the **Illuminated Ones** for now.

**Q:** When is **Technical Readout 3055** coming out?

**A:** See **What's Cooking at FASA** below.

**Q:** Where are the rules for **Swords**, **Self Destruct** device, etc.?

**A:** See **Unbound** above.

**Q:** What are the rules concerning shields?

**A:** See **MechaPress**, Issue #1.
