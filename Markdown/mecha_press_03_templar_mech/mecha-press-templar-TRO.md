## OVERVIEW

The year is 3054. Solaris is going through another booming season, a trend that hasn't relented since the beginning of the Clan invasion. Today's arenas are the site of many flamboyant fights, with many tag team matches, more **Clan Style** matches.

A couple of light years away, on the planet Hesperus II, one of the greatest robberies of all time has occurred. Defiance Industries of Hesperus II, under contract to the Federated Commonwealth, have spent the last two years working on advanced BattleMechs. Unfortunately, the first prototype of the most promising design, the **Beserker**, has been stolen by someone or some organization. FC intelligence was alerted immediately.

While investigation pursued the possibility of an inside connection, agents on **Solaris VII** reported a sighting of an inside connection. As the operatives were unable to mount an effective recuperation, due to ongoing Clan shadow war activities, the Seven Deadly Sins stable was called into action.

The stable received the **Templar**, a tested BattleMech based on the **Cavalier** chassis by Earthworks. The **Templar** is the product of Project Avatar, based at the secret facility of Echo Mirage. This 'Mech is a combination of the best technology available to Echo Mirage and was specifically designed for the **Unbound** incident for retrieval or destruction of sensitive technology, to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.
