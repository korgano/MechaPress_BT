Abaleen Consortium is the newest design firm on Solaris VII. They follow the traditions of their forebears by designing and building an eccentric looking "Mech, something fight fans love. The *Corvus* is a fifty-ton BattleMech that shares some of the *Shadow Hawk*'s looks and new features.

When Nashan Diversified, a giant FedCom firm but newcomer to the weapon industry, was struggling with the idea of building an entire line of weapons, the engineering staff decided to standardize the autocannons of all sizes on a single caliber. The A-series AC, the B-series LB 10-X and the U-series Ultra AC/5 are all based on a new 100 mm caseless shell. Furthermore, the autocannons use a gatling-like barrel system, where the multiple barrels are rotated for heat dissipation. Larger models simply have more barrels and a higher rate of rotation.

The *Corvus* also carries the Nashan C-series four-shot short range missile launcher. The Nashan SRM stresses part simplification by grouping internal components into modules. Thus, a single launch tube is the same for the SRM-2, 4, and 6. Obviously, this has lead to the adoption of a box-like shape.

Even if Abaleen seems to be a small firm, many things point toward the involvement of a business giant. Solaris commentators have been speculating that Nashan is behind Abaleen, since the *Corvus* carries a weapon package that was released only two weeks prior to the 'Mech's introduction.
