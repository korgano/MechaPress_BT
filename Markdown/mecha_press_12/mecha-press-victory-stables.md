# VICTORY STABLES

*By Jake Brenner*

Solaris VII: the game world. A place where almost anything can and does happen, where the politics and the events of the Inner Sphere are replayed on a smaller scale.

The various arenas of the Game World are the perfect setting to test new and upcoming equipment. Nashan Diversified, one of the large industrial conglomerates of the Inner Sphere, has understood that fact and founded their own design branch on Solaris just for that purpose.

This gave them access to the Solaris armament market, but not to the general, mainstream competition circuit, so Nashan founded Victory Stables. This new stable exists solely to promote the company's equipment and is, for the most part, a publicity stunt.

## Facilities

Victory maintains a small training facility at Beggar's Hills, 100 km north-east of Solaris City. It is nothing more than a large ferrocere field, studded with walls, holoprojectors and sensors. Mock battles are also held in the forests nearby.

The living areas are underground in a reinforced bunker. The accommodations are comfortable, although a bit Spartan. Simulators and gyms are available to the Mechwarriors, as well as viewrooms where they can review previous fights. An extensive databank on all current Victory fighters is also available.

Victory has access to Nashan SolDesign's arena when no fights are scheduled. Because of its recording equipment and the simplicity of the battlefield, the arena is used to test new designs, weapons, and strategies.

## Comments

Victory is a good stable, but it is a bit maligned because of its unaffiliated nature. Since it exists solely to test Nashan equipment and push their stuff on the weapons market, it cannot afford to take political sides.

Moreover, the money Nashan provides makes it easy to keep the machines and the pilots in perfect condition, and this is starting to show. Analysts predict that Victory should enter the Top 20 very soon. Hagger has already started to reinforce security around the stables.

## Tech Personnel

**KOICHI IMAGAWA**

Senior Tech

Koichi Imagawa is a small, Japanese man who looks more like a Buddhist monk than one of the best techs on Solaris. Imagawa has been working for Nashan for many years, and is completely loyal to the company.

Calm and quiet, Imagawa is dedicated to improving his craft constantly. New tech captured in some of Nashan's operations has sometimes sent him to study and evaluation.

**CHARLES FERGUSON**

Instructor

Like many other drill instructors on Solaris, Charles Ferguson started his career in the military. Years spent fighting in various parts of the Inner Sphere have made him cynical and cold, although he does know his stuff. What many people do not know is that Ferguson cares deeply for the men and women training under him, and views each and every one of their victories as a personal triumph.

**DIANE HAGER**

Weapon Master

Diane Hager is a small and delicate woman, but this does not prevent her from working on a multi-ton PPC or helping out the guys in the training gym. An accomplished martial artist, Diane has won her fair share of tournaments and is well-liked by all for her no-nonsense, easy-going personality. Like her father before her, she is entirely dedicated to Nashan.

## Combat Personnel

**EDWIN MULLER**

Senior Mechwarrior

Muller was part of Ferguson's unit in the last days of the Fed/Combine War of 3039. When Ferguson signed on with Nashan, he proposed that Muller come with him.

Muller didn't join the team until five years later, though, when the mercenary unit he belonged to was wiped out. He made his way to Solaris and was quickly accepted as Senior Mechwarrior for the fledgling Victory Stables.

**JULIE O'HARA**

Mechwarrior

With a temperament as fiery as her hair, Julie has been a fan favorite ever since she joined the stables ten years ago. Apart from the fact that she was born in the Free Rasalhague Republic, not much is known about her past.

Julie is quite beautiful, and she uses this to her advantage. She has made countless holos and print-ads, and is one of the rising figures in the world of arena fighting.

**OHIRO KIKURU**  

Mechwarrior Recruit

![](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_12_ch06.png)

A young and inexperienced newcomer, Ohiro nevertheless manages to impress in combat. Calm and competent, he has many common interests with Victory's Senior Tech and the two of them are often seen discussing together.

Ohiro is especially interested in the stables' experimental machines, the Pit Bulls. Diane is suspicious, but so far Ohiro has a spotless record.

## BATTLEMECHS

Victory Stables has four of Aboleen's newest designs, the 50-ton Corvus (see page 41). It also has one Locust, one Commando, two Pit Bulls, one Hatchetman, two Crusaders, one Grasshopper, one Orion, one Victor, one Zeus and one Stalker.

**Pit Bulls**

An experimental 'Mech by SolDesign, the Pit Bull is the Inner Sphere counterpart to the Clans' OmniMechs (for full stats and rules, see **Mecha Press 11**). The two NSD-01 owned by the stable are modified models with reinforced weapon hardpoints. They can't change their weapons during a battle, and the connection breaks on a roll of 6 when an arm pod is hit.

While the two machines sport the standard Victory paint scheme, each also bears a grinning dog maw and a name stenciled on its body. Pit Bull-01 is "Satan"; Pit Bull-02 is known as "Dagon".

**Locust**

The smallest 'Mech of the stable, the Locust is an old, but well-maintained LCT-1E, sporting a medium laser in each arm and two small lasers in its chin turret. It is often used by the newcomers trying to prove themselves to the stablemaster.

**Commando**

The Commando is a standard Lyran COM-2D model. It was bought from the Commonwealth years ago to serve, stripped of weapons, as a testbed for some of Nashan Hydraulics' new systems. Now refurbished and rearmed, "Old Peaceful" is back in combat. It still limps a bit, the result of a failed structural test that was never corrected (-1 to Piloting Roll).

**Hatchetman**

With the Federated Commonwealth switching to the newest HCT-55 model, several old HCT-3F Hatchetman are offered up for sale as updated units replace them. "Logger", as the 'Mech is called, uses an advanced Defiance LB-10X autocannon, using the weight savings to reinforce its hatchet. Other than that, the 'Mech is a standard HCT-3F in good condition.

**Corvus**

Since the weapons carried by the Corvus are all manufactured by Nashan Diversified, it's easy to understand why Victory fields four of them.

Corvus-01 and 02 are standard, brand new 'Mechs direct from Aboleen. The Corvus is not very powerful, but the fact that it just cannot run hot makes it very popular with young, inexperienced Mechwarriors.

Corvus-03 is modified to carry a PPC, two medium lasers and four additional heat sinks, dropping the autocannon. Its recent successes in the arenas have prompted Aboleen to reconsider whether or not the LB-10X was such a good idea.

Corvus-04 is also a non-standard model, the LB-10X being replaced by a Nashon experimental D-series LRM 15 launcher with two tons of missiles replacing the A/C ammo. This version also carries two medium lasers, one in each arm, and two additional heat sinks.

**Crusaders**

Both Crusaders were bought from a mercenary unit down on its luck. After some extensive refurbishing by Imagawa and his team, the machines ended up as crowd favorites in several matches.

Crusader-01, "Lionheart", is a standard CRD-3R. For some unknown reason, the computer is more lenient than usual when it comes to accepting overrides, making the Mech a ferocious fighter (reduce all Avoid Shutdown Targets by 1; Heat Scale is otherwise unaffected). Imagawa suspects computer tampering, but the Mechwarriors convinced him not to fix it.

Crusader-02 is a modified CRD-3K. "Gunner" had its medium lasers replaced by twin machine guns assemblies, augmenting its rate of fire and making it a deadly close fighter.

**Grasshopper**

The Grasshopper came from the same unit as the two Crusaders. It was in worse shape, however, and Imagawa refuses to let anyone use it before he's satisfied with his "adjustments".

**Orion**

The Orion is a recent addition to the team. It was taken as salvage from a recent victory in the Steiner stadium. Apart from the fact that it's still missing a functional head assembly, the Mech is in good shape.

**Victor**

The Victor was Ferguson's personal Mech before he started to work for Nashon. He only lets his most promising pilots use it, and then only for important matches. Ferguson has been discussing with Gordon the possibility of buying a Gauss rifle to replace the Victor's A/C20. Diane is entirely for the idea, and has already forced her weapon crew to learn all they could about Gauss technology.

**Zeus**

The Zeus was bought at about the same time as the Hatchetman. It is an aging ZEU-6S, but is otherwise in perfect condition. It is equipped with an updated arm assembly, which replaces the autocannon with a Lightning Strike PPC and two heat sinks.

**Stalker**

The heavy hitter of Victory, the Stalker is rarely used these days. Not only is it expensive to field, but its bulk makes it unsuitable for several interesting arenas like Ishiyama or the Factory. Interestingly enough, the Mech was never named: it is always referred to as "the Stalker" or just "it".

## ADVENTURE SEEDS

The following notes are adventure seeds and ideas involving Victory Stables. They can be used with Mechwarrior (1st or 2nd edition) or as background for Solaris VII or Battletech fights.

- Nashan is studying a new design at Victory Stables and the players

  a) have been ordered to steal it,

  b) have been offered to test it,

  c) must fight against it.

- One of Nashan's Mechwarriors has a grudge against one of the players. Will Nashan intervene or let him fight it out in the arena?

- A mysterious package was delivered to the stables late last night. Could it be a captured Clan weapon? The players' superior thinks so, and wants them to get it. Whether or not the package is actually a weapon is up to the GM.

- Victory is expanding, and they are looking for new talent. The stablemaster is holding a series of battles to determine who's good enough to make the team.

- A tech from a rival stable has been found tampering with the Victor's autocannon. Ferguson is mad, and decides a little revenge is in order. Anyone interested in pulling the stunt of the century?

- Imagawa is on vacation in a small Buddhist temple in the countryside. Unfortunately, just before the big match of the season, the Stalker refuses to move. It's a race against time as the stable's personnel tries to stall the match, fight with an interior machine or get Imagawa back to the compound!

- "Satan", one of the stable's experimental Pit Bull BattleMechs, has been stolen. The stablemaster wants the matter dealt with quickly and quietly. Who could be responsible for the theft? A rival stable, the yakuzas, the army, or perhaps... the Clans?
