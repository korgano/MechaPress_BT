# MECHA DESIGNS AND MODIFICATIONS

by Stephane Matis

We proudly present our first newly designed BattleMech, created with our optional modification to the construction rules. The design, called the CAVALIER, is based on the Japanimation mecha from the MS GUNDAM series: the RX-78 Perfect GUNDAM.

## OPTIONAL RULES

### THE SHIELD

The Cavalier's Shield was specially conceived to take advantage of the GUNDAM look. The rule governing shields follows.

- The shield weighs 2 tons for each 15 tons, or fraction thereof, that the BattleMech weighs. It also takes up one critical space in the arm for every 15 tons. This gives the 90 ton Cavalier a 12 ton Shield that occupies 6 criticals in the arm.

- The shields internal structure is the same as twice the shields weight. In our example, the Cavalier's shield has 24 internal structure points, allowing it to carry 48 points of armor. Full armor is included in the weight.

- The shield also has room to carry mines, hidden and protected. For every 30 tons of the Mech, or fractions thereof, the shield has room for a mine. In this case, the Cavalier's shield carries 3 mines of various type.

### HOW TO USE THE SHIELD.

Every time your 'Mech gets hit in one of the following locations: the shield carrying arm, the front torso or the head, another die roll should be made. This roll determines if the shot hit the predetermined location or the shield. The attacking player should roll one die and interpret the result on the table. Damage to the shield is applied to the shield carrying arm's armor. Note: The shield is NOT detachable without technicians.

### LOCATION IDENTIFIER

1. Shield intercepts
2. Original location
3. Original location +1 (max 12)
4. Original location -1 (min 2)
5. Shield intercepts
6. Shield intercepts

If a Torso critical is rolled and the shield intercepted the shot, there is still a chance for severe damage. Roll one die and consult the table below for effect.

1. Critical hit has no effect. Apply damage normally.
2. Double damage.
3. The mine release mechanism is jammed.
4. The mine arming and control system shorts out.
5. The shield connection breaks and the arm suffers 1D6 internal damage. The shield falls to the ground in the current hex. There goes your extra protection!
6. All mines detonate. Apply damage directly to the shield carrying arm's armor first. Damage transfers normally.

### MINES

There are three types of mine that can fit into the shields mechanism. The traditional command detonated mine, the Vibrobomb and the electro magnetic pulse (EMP). They all require to be armed before release. This operation can be performed in one BattleTech turn or each step requires one incidental action per ton in Solaris VII scale.

Once released, the mine can occupy any hex in the front arc of the BattleMech. The rules on mines, except for the EMP, can be found in the BATTLETECH Compendium, page 60. For EMP mines, use the Vibrobomb rules, except that the mine detonates, roll 2D6 for each 'Mech in the same hex for BattleTech scale or the same hex and surrounding hexes for Solaris VII. On a 7 or higher, the unit is shut down for 1D6 turns, until the battle computer and sensors reset. If the 'Mech is moving, the MechWarrior needs to roll versus his Piloting Skill. The mine generates no actual damage, but falling damage applies.

### COST

A very new technology, the shield costs a whole lot. Current pricing is 20,000 C-bills per ton of shield weight. A more advanced, field detachable model is expected shortly, but the cost will soar to 50,000 C-bills per ton.
