# BATTLES FROM THE TRAINING FIELD

by Stephane Matis

One of the first thing you've got to know about the BATTLETECH universe is that heavy or assault 'Mechs are rare on the battlefield while light and medium 'Mechs are quite common. To get a better understanding of the BATTLETECH universes philosophy, just have a look at one of its 'Mechs: the Locust. Here, you should read: LOW COST.

Consequently, your first 'Mech should be a small, inexpensive and a common machine. Therefore a light 'Mech, no more than 35 tons should be your first choice. Once you've chosen the type of 'Mech you wish to pilot (here we suggest a random choice), walk it out on the training field and get ready for your first fight.

For your first battle, your opponent should pilot a BattleMech of the same type as the one you have chosen for yourself. This will help both of you realize quickly the strengths and weaknesses of your 'Mech. Also, the 'Mechs being equal to one another should you rely more on tactics and strategies than on the overall superiority of your particular BattleMech model.

You should repeat the same combat a few times, until none of the opponents can achieve a decisive victory. These combats don't always have to take place in the same type of combat environment. For example, you could fight your first duel on an open field, giving you a chance to get accustomed to the moving and targeting rules of the game. Then, your second duel could take place on the traditional mixed wood-and-open field, where you would get to practice all the other rules. Other duels can be fought inside and around cities or on mountainous fields.

BATTLETECH is similar to playing chess except that you have two or more pieces facing each other on the game board, fighting according to a more varied set of rules. We recommend staying away from excessively large battlegroups (over 12 'Mechs) until you are adept.

In the BATTLETECH universe, the price of defeat is often death. So, if you play the game and lose, it's ok. In make-believe, you always have the next time!

## OPTIONAL RULES

Many players appreciate added realism in a game, so do we. Therefore, we propose some optional rules to enhance the basic rules of BATTLETEch games. You should first become accustomed to the basic rules of BATTLETEch before you add all the expert or optional rules.

## HIDDEN MOVEMENT

When playing on a field that features trees, mountains or buildings, it is not always obvious when a Mech can or cannot see another Mech. Furthermore, once it has been determined that the machines can no longer see each other, each player is supposed to lose sight of the opposite player's playing piece. Consequently, you're facing a situation where player conflicts could happen. To prevent this situation from happening, you can introduce a rule for hidden movement.

To begin, let's take a look at the rule concerning line-of-sight. The rule specifies that almost anything which stands as tall or taller than a BattleMech blocks the LOS (Line-of-Sight). The list of such objects includes: woods, mountains, buildings, DropShips etc...

Woods only block LOS whenever there are three light wood hexes (or greater) in between BattleMechs. By the rules, they are hidden from each other, but reading one of the BATTLETECH novels, you learn that Mechs are equipped with a MAG SCAN. The function of that piece of equipment is to detect any concentration of metal. Since 'Mechs are constructed with all sorts of different metals, they appear on the monitor of the scanner, giving away their current position. Thereby, you don't need a hidden movement rule to take over in this situation.

Mountains have different levels of elevation and a mountain of an elevation of two and higher, blocks the LOS of a 'Mech. According to what you have read, the MAG SCAN does not always work properly when used to detect a BattleMech through a hill, a mountain or a mound of rocks. Consequently, it creates a perfect situation for hidden movement.

Finally, buildings, DropShips and other such *installations* have the same effect on the LOS as mountains, but they don't affect the MAG SCAN in the same way. The effectiveness of the scanner depends on the concentration of metal in the *installation* and the frequency of such *installations*. So, the more buildings you find, the less effective your device will become. Therefore, in a combat taken place in a major industrial city, full of Heavy and Hardened factories and other such buildings, the scanner will simply go wild and become useless. Again, a perfect setting for a hidden movement rule.

The hidden movement rule requires a Game Master. It will be the G.M.'s responsibility to keep track of each player's 'Mech(s) and to determine a few factors about the field setup.

The G.M. should decide if mountains, hills or other such landmarks contain sufficient mineral substances and/or buildings are numerous enough to interfere with the functioning of the MAG SCAN. The chart below explains the effect of different combat environments on that device. In the chart, the word Mountains stands for mountains, hills and rock hillocks.

When you roll two six-sided dice and the result is a malfunction, the MAG SCAN gives you a reading that is in the least confusing. As result, you simply lose track of your opponents on MAG SCAN for that turn or the rest of the game, if the result shown in the chart is Always. Make this roll at the beginning of the turn, before any movement is resolved.

There are two ways to keep the game fair. First, the G.M. may setup two identical maps, for each player or player groups. The two maps should be hidden from each other by whatever means available. The G.M. now becomes the eyes, ears and MAG SCAN for each team. All pieces that appear and disappear in these cat-and-mouse fights, are under the control of the G.M. We recommend more than one G.M. if the combat is complex or the 'Mechs numerous.

The other method requires that the pieces be removed from the board. Players' 'Mechs are only placed when LOS exists at the end of a phase. Phases are optional, borrowed from other combat based games. Using the phasing turn below, the G.M. subdivides each BattleTech turn into *n* phases, where *n* is the running speed of the fastest 'Mech. In the chart, an X indicates movement of a hex or a hex side change.

The players plot their move on an appropriate small-scale map. Once each of themhave their movement done, the G.M. re-enacts the fight, as seen by each 'Mech. Note, this style of combat is perfect for both very light 'Mechs and city fighting 'Mechs, as combat expectancy is relatively short after LOS contact.

### HIDDEN MOVEMENTS:

| Type of Field | Type of Building | Density | Malfunction On |
|---------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| Mountains     | -                | None    | Never          |
| Mountains     | -                | Low     | 11+            |
| Mountains     | -                | Average | 7+             |
| Mountains     | -                | High    | 3+             |
| City          | Light            | Low     | Never          |
| City          | Light            | Average | Never |
| City          | Light            | High    | 11+            |
| City          | Medium           | Low     | Never          |
| City          | Medium           | Average | 11+            |
| City          | Medium           | High    | 8+             |
| City          | Heavy            | Low     | 11+            |
| City          | Heavy            | Average | 8+             |
| City          | Heavy            | High    | 5+             |
| City          | Hardened         | Low     | 8+             |
| City          | Hardened         | Average | 5+             |
| City          | Hardened         | High    | Always         |

### PHASING TABLE:

| RUN MOVEMENT | PHASES |
|--------------|--------|
| 2 - 3        | X      |
| 4 - 5        | X X    |
| 6 - 7        | X X X  |
| 8 - 9        | X X X X|
| 10 - 11      | X X X X X|
| 12 - +       | X X X X X X|

X indicates that 'Mech can move a hex. Note: there are two cycles per turn.
