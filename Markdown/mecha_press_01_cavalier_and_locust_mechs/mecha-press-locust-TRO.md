# LCT-2MP LOCUST

![Locust BattleMech](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_01_locust.png "Locust BattleMech")

## OVERVIEW
The Locust, in it's original configuration, was a scout with very little combat capability. To correct this weakness, Bander BattleMechs modified the Locust's chassis to incorporate a lighter XL engine. They also removed the two machine guns and their ammo. These weight saving allowed them to add a second Martell medium laser, effectively doubling the Mech's firepower. An interesting feature is the Arrowite split-configuration SRM-6-pack. It is similar in all respects to a conventional SRM-6, except that the missile tubes are split into two different locations. The reload ammunition is also split into two areas, where the extra feeding mechanisms require a critical location on each side. Note, if one side is destroyed, then the entire SRM is disabled. Ammo explosions only count for the number of missiles in the area affected.
