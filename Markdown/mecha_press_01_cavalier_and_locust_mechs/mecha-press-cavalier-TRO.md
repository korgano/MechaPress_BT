!["Cavalier BattleMech - Perfect Gundam Conversion"](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_01_cavalier.png "Cavalier BattleMech - Perfect Gundam Conversion")

## OVERVIEW
The Cavalier is an Assault BattleMech targeted for Solaris VII arena fights. The design is optimum for close combat with two medium pulse lasers and six small pulse lasers. It only carries one long range weapon: an extended range PPC. Exceptional speed for such a large 'Mech, the Cavalier is also jump capable and has the advanced MASC system installed for even quicker charges and retreats. What sets the Cavalier apart from other 'Mechs, even those designed for Solaris VII combat, is the use of the shield. The shield allows the Cavalier to intercept shots and physical blows, giving the pilot an edge in defense. The mines hidden on the reverse side of the shield also add to the Cavalier's notoriety. During a recent Open Class event, an EMP mine was used by upcoming celebrity MechWarrior Terrence Huse, a pilot working for the White Hand stable. Where the stable acquired such rare mine is still a mystery.
