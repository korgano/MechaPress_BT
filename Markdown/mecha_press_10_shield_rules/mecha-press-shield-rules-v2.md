Small darkened amphitheater filled with students. A professor standing inside a hologram of a *Marauder*, pointing at individual components.

“As you can see, the newest design goals are taking us away from the humanoid form. We are now looking at insects as the best representation of BattleMechs, due to the chitaneous protection inherent in their shape. Their armor is overlapped in natural progression, not requiring anything as silly as the proposed shield experiments…”

“Professor!”

“Oh, sir. Buckaroo, I suppose you have something to say against that?” <grunt>

“Well sir, I don’t believe that the idea of using shields should be dismissed in an offhand manner. As we all know, BattleMechs are mostly bipedal humanoid combat machines, with all the inherent advantages and disadvantages of knights of past. in both hand-and long range engagements, shields were capable of limiting damage to the combatant for extended periods. That would be a boon."

“Well, yes... but you forget that the crossbow put an end to most useful shields in combat. As for long range confrontation, anti-missile system can take care of the majority of incoming warheads. What you are proposing is to shift into the archaic, where battles are fought close in with punches and kicks... and I wouldn't be surprised that next thing you would propose are swords, clubs and axes for your designs. Such barbarisms in warfare have long departed in favor of long range, clean fights, where technology has more effect over the outcome.”

You may be a learned scholar and excellent surgeon Dr. Banzai, but you have no talent for modern warfare. I suggest you stick to your hobbies like time travel!"

*<Laugh> Good. The whole class is laughing at him. I knew that this crack about Dr. Banzai and his “team’s” arrival in 2764 Terra would get the students going. What a bunch of silly lies! Time travel! Indeed. <Snort>*

“Wow! Take a look at that!”

“Oh, that’s the latest Team Banzai creation. Hey Jack, stop gaping like an imbecile.”

“I know it’s a Team Banzai Mech, but look at that monster! It must weigh at least 60 tons! Look, it’s equipped with one of those new SHIELDS! That is Mondo Cool!”

“You are such a mecherd Jack! I mean, really, who gives a snake's armpit about some funky Banzai creation anyway. Not like they gonna build many of them. That thing is way too radical to be accepted by the military.”

“Oh yeah Miss Know-it-all! Well, for your information Tracy, that thing is the Top Secret SWRD-2X1 *Swordsman* and it just got cleared by the Prince for combat testing.”

“Bah! It will never get anywhere! The Clans will have it for breakfast!”

*Hmm... so this is the Swordsman. Good, let’s get a couple of close-ups and drop the film chip off tonight. Precentor Aziz will be proud of my work!*

## SHIELDS

The enigmatic Team Banzai is at it again. They were contracted by the Federated Commonwealth Military to experiment with any wild ideas that may help with the fight against the Clans. Given such a "carte blanche", the design team revived even the oldest of their research ideas. Thus, the dusty files describing the BattleMech shield came to light again.

## Designing a Shield

The shield technology presented herein was first proposed during the early days of Star League. The Arthurnian design style in full swing, swords and shields received some attention. The bane of all this research was the Marauder BattleMech and its progeny. The purely humanoid shapes were forever banished from all research and development. The insectoid designs were in ascendance.

Shields are built exclusively with Endo Steel base covered with Ferro-Aluminum armor. [Ferro Aluminum is the Ferro Fibrous armor used on fighters — ed.] The production resembles that of advanced Aerospace armor. Originally, the general shape of the shield was rectangular, with smoothed corners. While in re-design, Team Banzai chose the stretched hexagon shape instead. The shield's shape doesn't really affect its effectiveness, but Team Banzai has a reputation to maintain.

- The shield's weight, minus five percent (5%) of the BattleMech's weight, is added to the total "Mech weight like a weapon. The five percent weight reduction comes from the fact that a BattleMech can lift and carry it to that amount in one hand without penalties. This is a freebie, so enjoy! (of course this means that you can't pick up anything else unless you drop the shield.)

- The shield's internal structure is designed in increments of 0.5 tons. Each increment gives 8 points of internal structure.

- Ferro-Aluminum armor can be bought in increments of 0.5 tons, much like for a 'Mech, but the maximum armor is up to three (x3) times that of the internal structure, much like the head of a 'Mech.

- The shield takes a single critical in the shield carrying arm. If the critical is damaged, the connection will break off, leaving the shield behind. All shields are detachable and are equipped with a Universal Coupler, enabling their use on all shield-carrying BattleMechs.

- A BattleMech needs to have both upper-arm and lower-arm actuators to make effective use of a shield. Lacking either or having them damaged, will penalize ANY Piloting/Mech skill roll by 1 unless the shield is dropped.

- No more than one shield may be mounted on each arm. Shields may not be mounted on torsos, head, or legs. Quads cannot mount shields.

- Total shield(s) weight should not exceed one tenth (1/10) of the BattleMech's weight. For every successive 1/10 or fraction thereof, Piloting/'Mech rolls are penalized by 1. In addition, past 1/10, the 'Mech will suffer from loss of MPs: -3 MP or half it's walking speed, whichever is less.

## Shield Use

When a BattleMech is equipped with a shield, the following rules apply in all combat situations.

- A shield can be used either in a passive or active way.
  - Passive shield parry assumes that the pilot still concentrates on fighting. 
  - Active shield parry allows for more defense, at the cost of all offensive actions.

- The player receives a number of parries per turn equal to his Piloting/'Mech quality. The table below summarizes. The first number is for passive parity, the second for active.

| Pilot Quality | Pilot Base | Shield Parries |
|---------------|----------------|-|
| Green         | 6 or more      | 1/2          |
| Regular       | 4-5            | 1/3          |
| Veteran       | 3              | 2/3          |
| Elite         | 2 or less      | 2/4          |

## Notes:

- Passive shield parry allows the pilot to fire weapons and engage in physical combat. Active shield parity DOES NOT.

- The number of shields present DOES NOT increase the number of parries available to the pilot.

- When parrying, the pilot can decide which shield he's using if the 'Mech has two of them.

- To use the shield against an incoming attack, the player must declare his intention after he hears of the particular attack(s) in the Declaration Phase. If the player wishes to withhold a parry for the Physical Phase, he must declare it after all attacks have been declared in the Declaration Phase.

- The player rolls a Piloting/'Mech skill roll to "parry" the incoming attack. All Piloting rolls modifiers are effective.

- Shields can be used to parry attack from the front, left and right arcs. Torso twisting will modify these arcs as per the rules. Shields can also be used against attacks from the top, even if they enter through the rear arc. (See strafing rules below.)

- The 'Mech's shield-carrying arm is automatically protected at all times, except for attacks from the opposite side arc. Any damage that would go to the arms is first taken off the shield.

- Excess damage to the shield transfers to the shield-carrying arm.

- If the shield armor is breached and the shield internal structure is hit, there is a chance for criticals. Roll for number of criticals. Roll another 1D6; if the value is under or equal to the number of criticals, the shield connection is broken. A roll of 12 is assumed to be a shield destroyed AND a transfer of a single critical on the arm.

- The weapons of a shield carrying arm cannot be fired if the shield is to be used.

- If the shield is used as a weapon, treat the attack as a normal punch but divide the damage into two even groups to represent the greater contact area. Because of the additional mass involved in the punch, the target 'Mech must make a Piloting Roll to remain standing if hit by the shield.

- If the BattleMech suffers shoulder damage or if the adjacent torso is destroyed, the shield becomes unusable.

- Shields can be used against both direct and indirect artillery and strafing attacks. Direct artillery attacks are resolved the same way as any regular weapon attack. When the incoming attack is indirect, the pilot suffers a +2 penalty to his roll. Against direct artillery, the pilot can declare that he is shielding himself INSTEAD of firing back. The shield will absorb as much of the incoming damage as possible. All these attacks reduce the pilot's shield use to a single action.

- Internal attacks and configuration (napalm) artillery rounds that are intercepted have their effects reduced by half, rounded down.

- When the shield intercepts fire by a Gauss Rifle or Gauss artillery, there is a chance that the damage will crystallize the metal structure and the shield will buckle. On a roll of 1 on 1D6, the shield cracks, losing half of its damage absorption on top of the damage done by the Gauss weapon.

- When the shield intercepts fire from advanced warhead missiles, artillery and advanced ammunition not covered by these rules, the pilot and Mech agree on a plausible outcome and stick to the agreement for the rest of the game. The standard approach is to assume that the shield's armor and internal structure suffer the same fate as the Mech would.

## Shield Availability

The Federated Suns side of the Federated Commonwealth is the sole user of the shield as of 3055. Team Bazani freely distributes the specifications for the 'Mechshield coupler and they sell specifications and blueprints for shields. The price for mercenaries is 5 M C-Bits per blueprint, 50 M C-Bits per government or company. So far, only Wolf's Dragoons are known to have bought a copy.

## Shield Cost and Maintenance

A shield's Combat Value is twice the total Combat Value of its Endo Steel internal structure and the Ferro-Aluminum armor on top of it. Endo Steel counts for 2 Combat Value per point of internal and Ferro-Aluminum counts for 1 Combat Value per point. Double this total to find the shield's total Combat Value.

### Shield cost:
- 5,000 C-bills for shield coupler.
- 10,000 C-bills Base shield cost
- 1,600 C-bills per 0.5 ton of Endo Internal Structure
- 20,000 C-bills per ton of Ferro-Aluminum Armor.

## HISTORICAL NOTES

The shield-equipped *Watchman II* (see page 36 for more information about this new machine) is expected to be ready for the anniversary of the Federated Commonwealth. Observers note that the design may appear much earlier if the political situation worsens. The 'Mech is slated to be built at Valiant System on Robinson, Acheron BattleMechs on New Avalon and Johnston Industries on New Styris. The total output in a single year is expected to exceed 80 *Watchman II*s from the combined factories.

The *Watchman II* is equipped with the older Bregle Active Probe, as Bloodhound units are being incorporated into newer 'Mechs. The ChisComp 43 Special Large Laser was replaced on the new model with the ChisComp 78 Extended range model. Retired Watchmans will still maintain the older laser to keep costs of upgrades lower. The SperryBrowning MGs were by the new Valiant SureHure Streak-2. The launcher is in the left torso and is usually armed with AP (Anti-Personnel) warheads. Finally, the two ChisComp 39 lasers were placed into the right torso, to allow their fire while the Mech is using its shield. Although the refitted *Watchmans* are going to include the same set of weaponry, the *Watchman II* has a more distinct image, something designers are looking forward to.

Only one other FedCom design has been seen with the shield. The Top Secret SWRD-2X *Swordman* has been spotted around NAIS testing grounds, but information on this 'Mech is scarce.

Wolf's Dragon's Zeta battalion has recently been active in the Clan front. A single picture of a *Daishi* OmniMech carrying a shield has set the R&D community afire. The picture confirms rumors that Team Banzai's first mercenary customer for the blueprint was none other than the Wolfpack.
