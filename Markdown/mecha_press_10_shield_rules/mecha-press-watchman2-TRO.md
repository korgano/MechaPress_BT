# WTC-5A WATCHMAN TECHNICAL READOUT

By Stéphane Matis

Military dogma aside, when the shield was proposed to the FedCom high command, only the most antagonistic Lyran Generals balked at it. Needing their votes to receive further funding, Project Red Umbrella was shot down. The Davion-Stainer tension was deep felt in the R&D community, where projects were being segregated one way or another. Unwilling to abide by the decision and unwilling to count only Davion support, Team Banzai self-funded the remainder and finished the prototypes by late 3054.

The new shields were then ready to be included on a testbed 'Mech. The *Watchman* was the only BattleMech that was being tested at the NAIS compounds at the time, so Team Banzai "borrowed" the sixth prototype and modified it to testing.

The WTC-4X6 *Watchman* was the talk of the R&D halls for six months before the Prince heard about it. On a short visit to the New Avalon, to quiet complaints, the Prince made a visit to the Banzai hangar. The WTC-4X6 caught his eye, even if the shield was not in place. After ten minutes of questions about the design, the Prince asked for a demonstration.

New Avalon's obstacle course proved no match for the WTC-4X6. The shield blocked many of the unavoidable shots, making the pilot's score outstanding. Before leaving for the front, the Prince contracted Team Banzai to update the *Watchman* design for the upcoming FedCom anniversary. The constraints put on the design were similar to its original: keep it simple and inexpensive! The prototype WTC-5X1 was nicknamed "Le Petit Prince".
