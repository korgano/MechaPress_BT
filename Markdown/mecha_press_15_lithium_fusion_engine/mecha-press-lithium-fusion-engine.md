Welcome to Technology Corner, I'm Miles O'Brian.

Earlier this week, Lithium-Fusion Engines were introduced to the public for the first time and they were quickly hailed as a technological breakthrough.

The Lithium-Fusion Engine is the brainchild of GenLogic, a St-Ives Compact think tank. The design is a by-product of work carried out on contract for the Federated Commonwealth's Fox Class Corvette and the Draconis Combine's Kyushu Class Frigate. GenLogic distinguished themselves by designing the critical Lithium-Fusion adapters for both Warships.

The engine combines the best qualities of Lithium-Fusion batteries and fusion engines. The technology has been licensed to Earthworks Incorporated of Keystone, Free Worlds League, Independence Weaponry of Quenin, Draconis Combine, HildCo Interplanetary of St. Ives, St. Ives Compact and Abaleen Consortium of Solars VII now part of the Lyran Alliance.

In a related story, the giant Nashan Diversified has announced sweeping plans to immerse itself in design and production of military technology. To jumpstart their market presence, Nashan has made public the purchase of many smaller companies involved in the military market, including the Abaleen Consortium of Solars VII.

## LITHIUM-FUSION BATTERIES

Lithium-Fusion batteries are the pinnacle of energy storage technology. They are imbued with many desirable qualities: fast charge, smooth and rapid discharge, low weight. Lithium-Fusion (LF) technology would have become a household standard during the Star League era had it not found a powerful military application. Connected to a JumpShips core, a large bank of LF batteries could store an additional charge at negligible cost in weight, enabling the ship to jump twice before recharging. This single tactical advantage forced the technology onto the Cameron Block List, barring forever its civilian use.

Because of military secrecy surrounding LF batteries and the requirement of secure zero-g robotic factories, only a few Terran nations were allowed to produce them under military contracts. The Star League Navy's unconditional purchase of all stock left little chance for new developments until the Successor States recovered the knowledge in 3030. Unfortunately, high demand for LF batteries has led to price gouging, an effective obstacle to their widespread use.

In 3057, Lithium-Fusion technology is understood well enough to be taught in Universities, where sample units can be manufactured in shuttle experiments. This grass roots availability has led to much experimentation, like its inclusion in the expert sentry robot contest at NAIS.

On the flip side, most corporate production is funneled into lucrative sales for JumpShips refits and WarShip design. Some companies are holding back designs for their own research into yield and packaging but only a few have taken the uncharted path toward new and innovative applications.

## LITHIUM-FUSION ENGINE

The conservative BattleMech design concepts state that a 'Mech will reline its power requirements 80% of the time. To compensate, designers have always chosen to build 'Mechs with larger and heavier fusion engines, insuring ample power at all times. When weight is a premium, designers use XL engines built with a larger but lightweight super-compound shielding. A third alternative now exists: the Lithium-Fusion Engine.

A Lithium-Fusion Engine is an efficient cross-breed design between a traditional BattleMech fusion engine and LF batteries. The batteries provide the extra power required when firing weapons or engaging in intense physical activities. They are recharged whenever the fusion powerplant has surplus energy (at rest, walking, stationary, etc.).

Using up to date design concepts, the LF engine's design team saved weight by using a smaller fusion engine coupled with a series of LF batteries that help maintain constant power output even when redlining. To take advantage of the engine's design, a different power management software was also required to handle all these different power sources.

## GAME NOTES

To determine the Lithium Fusion engine size for a BattleMech, modify the Engine Rating Formula (**Compendium** p. 123, **10th Anniversary Edition Compendium** p. 100) to read:

Tonnage x ( Walking MP - 1 ) = Engine Rating

A total of 14 critical slots must be allocated to the Lithium-Fusion energy network. Like heat sinks, a number of Lithium-Fusion batteries equal to the engine rating divided by 25 (round down) are assumed to be an integral part of the engine. However, a maximum of nine batteries can be hidden in the engine, no matter its size. The remaining batteries are placed anywhere in the 14 criticals allocated to the LF network (1 critical per battery).

The engine produces a point of additional heat per turn for every destroyed LF battery under five (5). When more than five (5+) LF batteries are destroyed, reduce the 'Mech's walking speed by one and recalculate the running speed. The 'Mech will still continue to produce an additional five (5) heat until all damaged batteries are replaced.

Lithium-Fusion engine technology is incompatible with XL engine technology.

## SAMPLE BATTLEMECH

Industry pundits agree that Abaleen Consortium leaked the information on their new Arena 'Mech themselves. Codenamed *Prodigal Son* (see next page for stats), the BattleMech has been spotted at the Nashan SolDesign arena undergoing a rigorous shakedown.

Victory Stables will officially take control of the *Prodigal Son* in two months. Just a week later, their star Mechwarrior, Edwin Muller, will take on Sene Garcia from DeLon Stables for the 20th position on the fight circuit. Fight fans will certainly get an eyeful, as Sene Garcia will pilot a rare EXT-4D *Exterminator*.

Although the speed of both 'Mechs are closely matched, and even though the *Exterminator* carries more firepower, the analysts expect that Muller will easily win the match. Indeed, the close confines of the arena will make the *Prodigal Son*'s eight machineguns extremely deadly while making the missile launchers of his opponent practically useless. Moreover, since the Victory machine does not use missiles, the AMS of the *Exterminator* will be so much dead weight. It will definitely be an exciting match!

Don’t blame us when it ruins some Clans’ day.
