By Stéphane I. Maïs

To the untrained eye, the *Prodigal Son* cannot be easily differentiated from its progenitor, the *Corvus*. Although some cosmetic changes have been initiated, the overall look hides the new 'Mech's features well. So far, the following information has been confirmed.

The *Prodigal Son* was built around a powerful Lithium-Fusion Engine, which allows this sixty ton capable 'Mech to outpace almost anything in its class. To boost performance even further, the 'Mech has been equipped with stable Triple Strength Myomers. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Nashan paid huge sums of money for the myomers, a technology they cannot reproduce at present.

Being an arena design, the *Prodigal Son* sports high cycle rate machine guns and accurate pulse lasers. Eight caseless machine guns are mounted in a gatling configuration on the right torso. These machine guns follow engineering standards established by Nashan in their full-size autocannons. The two medium range pulse lasers are the first such weapons from Nashan. Although the lasers show amazing craftsmanship, the test models have been misfiring constantly. This bug may force the *Prodigal Son* to have a weapon's refit before its first arena fight.
