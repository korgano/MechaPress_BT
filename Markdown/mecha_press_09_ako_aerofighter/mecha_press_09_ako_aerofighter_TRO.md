For the avid Battletech player, this is a nice aerospace fighter; to the anime fan, however, this is a (hopefully) hilarious tribute to the well-known parody OVA "Project A-Ko".

This is the fighter which the Earth used to attack the alien ship once it entered the atmosphere. A-Ko used them as well as their missile like steps to get to the enemy ship! See if you can spot the various references in the Tech Readout...

Since the craft is rather small we chose a low tonnage. This limited us, of course. Streak-type SRM were installed under the wings to maximize ammo's utilization and require less heat sinks.The original concept called for a PPC under the nose, but we had to settle for a large laser to give the fighter enough fuel for combat.
