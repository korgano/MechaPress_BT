# LOST: A BATTLETECH STORY

By Jake Brenner

"Where the hell are they?" Mechwarrior Evan Mitchell was starting to lose both his patience and courage. To get lost on his first combat drop! Bad luck had always been to hang about him, and now it started to look like it could kill him.

His 20-ton *Cannon* pushed its way through the trees. Evan had been assigned to the small Mech barely two months ago, just enough time to make sure he would not make it trip over its own feet. He was then sent, along with a dozen of other apprehensive cadets, to help defend the frontier against Clan raiders. He was presently in a dense forest, probably tens of kilometers from the rest of his lance. They would not be looking for him, of course: they were too busy dealing with the Clan machines dropping from the sky like heavy rain.

The *Cannon*'s radar screen did not register any 'Mech in the close vicinity. But Evan knew better than to trust his machine's artificial senses. A Clan OmniMech could be hiding just behind that boulder with a Guardian — or even worse, an Angel — ECM suite turned on at full power — and he'd walk right in front of it. The thought made him shudder slightly. The *Cannon* seemed to hesitate, then resumed his walk.

Ten hours later, he was no closer to anyone. The gently rolling mountains he had entered three hours ago were marked on his map as bordering the assigned sector of Finnigan's Lance, but there were no signs of fear. He dared not broadcast for help for fear of pointing out his position to would-be Clan listeners. Evan sighted and turned his attention back to the front viewscreen. Exhaustion blurred his vision. He had been sitting in the command couch for sixteen hours straight, and his body rebelled at the thought of spending more time in the overheated cockpit. He had opened the external hatch for ventilation, but the tiny opening barely helped maintain the temperature at an almost normal level.

Evan eased the *Cannon* down beside a rock boulder. He was tired, but his training took over and he carefully checked and turned off every system, keeping the fusion engine at idle. He had almost turned it off when he remembered that it would have no way of starting it up again without another energy source. Reaching under the seat, he pulled out a light package containing an emergency survival pack.

He fully opened the cockpit and inhaled a deep breath of fresh evening air. There was a deep, pleasant smell of vegetation that seemed like heaven to the young pilot; he had just spent weeks aboard an overcrowded dropship, breathing recycled, smelly air.

The dim K8 sun had already disappeared behind the tree top, leaving just enough light for him to slowly pick his way down the "mech, avoiding the heart sinks carefully. The *Cannon* was sitting at the base of a small rock outcropping, its large metal legs forming solid armored walls around him. Evan thought about lighting a fire, but decided against it.

He ate his ration pack cold, in silence. His simple outfit helped support the fiendish heat of a BattleMech, but now it was only exposing Evan's flesh to the cold wind that blew between the trees. Evan shivered and reached into the survival pack, fumbling in the dark for his isolated coverall. He was putting them on when a sharp crack behind him made him dive for his laser pistol. He fell on the ground heavily, hampered by the half-drawn coverall, and fumbled to reach the weapon and his flashlight. He spun to align both with the sound.

It was a young girl, unconscious.

Evan approached her cautiously, illuminating her with the flashlight and keeping the gun centered on her head. Her short blond hair was a mess, and her coverall was torn and dirty, as if she had just spent weeks walking through the forest. The gun clip on her belt was empty. Underneath the coverall she wore a cooling suit of advanced design, as if the green bird marking on her left breast pocket was not enough to identify her as a Clan warrior.

Evan thought furiously. What was a Clan warrior doing this far out from the main drop site? Were the Clans attacking from another front? The questions rushed through his head, most of them unanswered. The girl was still unconscious — no, sleeping. He had tried to rouse her, but without much success. "She must be exhausted," he mumbled to himself.

He didn't know what to do. He could not take her with him, for she would never fit in the *Cannon*'s small cockpit, nor would he feel very safe with a born and bred warrior just behind his seat — conscious or not. He could carry her in the 'Mech's hands, but he should ever find himself drawn into a battle...

He yawned, suddenly conscious of how tired he was. He took another stimulant from the emergency pack. There was no way out, he would have to take her back to base. If only he could figure out where that was...

Evan hastily gathered his things and climbed back aboard the *Cannon*. He settled down in the couch but left the hatch open. The mech straightened and got to its feet. Evan carefully scooped up the sleeping form with the machine's right hand, then chose a direction at random. He would have activated his compass, but the magnetic monopolies in the ground would make such an operation practically useless.

The *Cannon* had barely covered a kilometer when he happened upon a small clearing in the wood. A Clan *Uller* was sitting there with its hatch open; startled, Evan almost opened up with the torso-mounted large laser when he remembered the girl's presence in his mech's hand. Besides, the Clan machine was obviously shutdown and no threat to him. Evan surmised that it belonged to the young girl. Other than the green bird marking of the attacking Jade Falcons and some ID numbers high on the left and right torso, the greenish color pattern was unbroken. Even the tip of the right arm autocannon was unsoiled.

"But why did she abandon it?" There was no visible damage on its camouflaged alloy hull, although internal mechanical problems would not be visible.

He toyed with the idea of dismounting and checking it out, but decided against it. The Starmates of the *Uller* girl could be one in the region, and Evan had no taste for one-against-four odds, Rules of Engagement or not. If only he knew where he was! The nav beacon would be useless, of course. It would have been disconnected to prevent the invaders from using it. The situation was not good, and Evan felt more tired than ever. He made a note of the approximate position of the "wreck" on his notepad. This is a mystery better left to others, he thought, and he continued past the unmoving war machine.

Evan had stopped to take a short nap, as he felt increasingly exhausted. Although he had programmed the computer to wake him up after three hours, he found that he had been sleeping for nearly twelve standard hours. He shook his head to clear it of the last fogs of sleep and found he could not. The girl was still sleeping.

Evan maneuvered the *Cannon* back into the small trail he had found earlier. He was now sure he could find his way out. The nav beacon was still silent, though, and that worried him. Had the entire garrison been wiped out to the last man, or was the battle still raging? A raid did not usually last this long. And why was she still sleepy?

The trees ahead thinned somewhat, and some light shone through the foliage. The end of the forest! At last, cried Evan, and he rushed through the gap.

To find himself in front of the *Uller*.

It had not moved, nor changed. It was still staring right ahead through its great sensor eye as if it was a cyclops told to wait for its master without making a sound. Evan strangled a cry of despair and gave up. Let them find him, it should be simpler than the other way around. If he waited here, he doubled his chances: the Clans would surely come looking for the girl.

Heaven, was he tired.

"The 28th Rangers have been decimated, Colonel. That victory costs us dearly," said the young lieutenant. He had just been assigned to the garrison and could still see the men and women of the place as mere statistics.

Colonel Mayer wished he could do the same. But he had worked with these people for months now, even the youngs who came just a few weeks ago. He made a point of knowing each and everyone of them, and he felt their loss deeply.

"What about the newcomers? The 25th, I believe?" They had been assigned to the left wing, a place where attack was unlikely.

"All dead, Colonel. I'm afraid that the unexpected Clan offensive on that flank took us by surprise. Wait." He punched a couple of keys on his tablet. "There is one mech listed as MIA: a mechwarrior Mitchell, I believe."

"Mitchell." Mayer remembered the unlucky young man. "What happened to him?"

"He probably got lost in the nearby forest. We have reports that he was followed by a Clan light 'mech, so he was probably killed along with the others. Unlucky to the end, heh?" Even the lieutenant had heard of Evan Mitchell's bad luck.

Mayer turned and smiled. "I think not, lieutenant." He turned back to the map. "Do you know how this forest is called, lieutenant?"

"I'm afraid not, sir. I know the sector's ID number, but the local name escaped me."

"They call it the 'Forest of Peaceful Rest'. Has something to do with the local biochemistry, I told: you just get sleepy and doze off." Mayer sat down at his desk. "The compound is present in minute quantities and not dangerous at all, so the 'mech's filters let it pass in the cockpit aeration system. That's why the forest is normally off limits."

"So Mitchell is..."

"Yes, probably sleeping in some clearing with a Clan warrior. Why don't you take some men in sealed suits and go look for him?"

"Yes sir! On our way." The lieutenant started to leave, but stopped at the door. "Forest of Peaceful Rest, huh?"

Mayer nodded. He sat back and grabbed his pipe. "I think that for once, just once, Mitchell got lucky."
