# GAL-2DSM CANNON TECHNICAL READOUT

By Jake Brenner

The multiple successes of the new Gallowglas BattleMech prompted Blackwell to begin a study on the possibility of using the design as a base for a line of new 'Mechs. The Cannon is the first of these new experimental machines.

The GAL-2DSM (for Down-Sized Model) is a scaled-down version of the Gallowglas. Like its larger brethren, it is equipped solely with energy weapons, eliminating any dependency on ammunition; an Endo-Steel skeleton, to save weight; and a standard engine, to increase battlefield survival and reduce construction cost.

The main punch of the Cannon, and the source of its name, is the torso-mounted Sunbeam large laser. Although this extended range model generates a lot of heat (more, in fact, than the heat sinks can normally handle), it does provide an excellent punch for so light a design.

Unfortunately, the Cannon also suffers from some deficiencies. The choice of standard heat sinks instead of the double strength models reduces the machine's endurance, while the absence of jumpjets is a major shortcoming. However, these flaws may be corrected by use of Clan-level technology, which Blackwell is reported to have.
