# NASHAN'S ARENA

By Stephane Matis & Marc A. Vezina

The boardroom fell silent as the Margrove began talking quietly. The room's other occupants strained to hear the words from the head of the table. Her voice carried authority while the words themselves were veiled in poetic style. When the Margrove decided that she had their attention in a firm grip, she began to speak louder and more forcefully. None would deny her authority here.

"This debate has been going on for too long. I gave six months for the board to come to a conclusion and you failed. This inability on your part influenced my decision to follow-up the proposal submitted by Ludwig, Henry and Fentier. Nashan Diversified will enter the lucrative military market. The move will contribute to our technology and security."

A low murmur cut through the crowd. Adjacent members turned to face each other, while their hushed commentaries barely reached the Margrove. She took the situation with her usual calm demeanor, but knew well that the representatives of Nashan Hydraulics would oppose her even now. As if on cue, the head of Nashan Hydraulics began in earnest.

"Margrove, I believe I talk for many at this tale. We understand your stance on this topic, but we are unable to fathom why we need such an elaborate and expensive implementation. The fact remains, the board is divided only because of the costs involved. If we were to cut the implementation costs in half, this board would approve faster than it takes a Tobarin to kill its prey."

*Curious. Does he really mean it?*

"And how do you propose to cut the price of the plan in half, Mr. Sandstorm?" the Margrove said quietly.

Sandstorm presented a pensive face. With a minute and a steady gaze, he said: "Well, first of all, we need to cut R&D by promoting the equipment into wide use faster. This can be achieved by selling to Solars Design Studios... of course, ... yes ... of course!"

With his eyes ablaze by the sudden idea, Sandstorm began to talk in a most animated fashion, stopping only to catch his breath. Margrove V had never seen this intense side of the young Director, and as she listened with apparent cold detachment, she saw the real genius. And as she listened further, her mind raced ahead to the time when she will retire and choose a successor, and she saw that her only logical choice will be William Sandstorm.

## NASHAN DIVERSIFIED

Nashan Diversified is the largest conglomerate in the Inner Sphere. The company got there by shrewd dealings and excellent business soave. Of course, detractors claim that Nashan got there by judicious blackmail and “Black Ops”. Either way, Nashan is a power to be reckoned with in the Inner Sphere, and the throne of this corporate empire rests in the hands of Margrave V.

Over the years, Nashan Diversified did just that. It diversified. The only real exception to their corporate holdings was the design and final assembly of military hardware. This peaceful stance didn’t originate from any higher purpose. The company simply didn't believe in freezing huge sums of money in slow to progress military R&D.

The Gray Death Corewas an unwelcome alarm to Nashan, as smaller companies would soon have access to technology only Nashan had been able to produce. The company quickly went on a buying rampage, scooping up would-be competition. The plans accounted for a slow rebuilding of cash reserves thus depleted.

Then the Clans made their presence known. Among the first industrial casualties were fringe companies of Nashan. Even the dreaded Nashan “Black Ops” were unable to fight these new military Titans. As the Clans advance conquered all of their wake, a boardroom debate quickly stalled Nashan Diversified. One faction called for increased military spending to protect company assets. The other faction, fearing that their precarious money reserves and their bottom line would be invariably hurt, proposed to sell those firms that would come into harm’s way. The bickering forced Margrave V to step into the fray and quit her corporate dominion. She immediately discounted both arguments and called for proposals. To forestall further infighting, she also opened the proposal process outside consultants.

When the board still did not come to a viable conclusion, the Margrave simply announced that she was going with the most expensive and technologically ground-breaking proposal. The Ludwig, Henry and Ferrier proposal was to clone the Clan OmniMechs.

Retired Major William Sandstrom, the Director of Nashan Hydraulics, was unconvinced by the whole proposal. He had already argued extensively against it and scored many valid points. First and foremost was that Wolf’s Dragons owned factories capable to build the OmniMechs and it might be cheaper to buy the technical plans, rather than spend Trillions of C-Bills re-inventing them. He was also careful to discount industrial “Black Ops” against the likes of Blackwell and 7th Commando.

On the fateful day’s decision, William Sandstrom opposed the Margrave V’s decision publicly. But when she prodded him for an alternative, he surprised himself with the answer: Nashan SolDesign: a new company marking Nashan’s entry into the lucrative and instructive world of Solaris VII competitive design and combat environment. The product: InnerSphere OmniMechs based on the in-house QuickConnect™ system. To enable the proper evaluation of the equipment, Nashan would even build an arena in the Solaris reaches, where new and diverse fighting styles would be promoted.

## NASHAN SOLDESIGN

Nashan SolDesign’s first action was to buy an entire mountain range in a remote region of Solaris VII. The site was closed off while the company built its research and design facilities and a small arena.

The arena itself was nothing exceptional; it looked very much like the standard terrain used for basic simulations by all Mechwarrior training academies. The main difference was the numerous sensors and cameras designed to record all aspects and actions of the combats for future analysis. The field is also special: several weapon pods lie around for whoever wants to pick them up.

The pods are scattered all over the conditions. The exact number of pods depends on the conditions of the particular match. The habitual number of pods is about 5-6 per machine. There are three types of pod: 4 tons, 8 tons, and close combat.

A pod can contain weapons, ammo (if needed), heatsinks, or simply dead weight. A few devious games have included bomb pods, Where the pod was actually dangerous to the user! A pod can contain anything — they all look the same, except that 8-ton pods have two connectors and are painted with red and white warning stripes. See the sidebar for a few sample pods.

The income from the holovision rights and the spectators serves to pay the cost of the R&D, so Nashan has next to nothing to pay for this operation. In addition, one out of three fights is done for charity, so many famous Mechwarriors attend and participate solely for this reason — Nashan, on the other hand, is happy to record the performance of their machines when piloted by some of the best on Solaris.

## Arena 'Mechs

Two new types of BattleMech were created expressively for this arena, the Pit Bull and the Pit Fighter. Both are 30 tonners (see attached stats) with no weapons.

Nashan's engineers observed that heavier 'Mechs tend to fight slugging matches — not very useful for collecting battle data. The BattleMechs' low weight class was chosen so that the pilot and the tactics would influence the fight more than the actual technology.

Each machine's arm ends in the patented QuickConnect™ system from Nashan. The QuickConnect™ is composed of three "fingers" and a fire control feed from the 'Mech central targeting computer. Weapon pods are equipped with special reversed connectors, so all a 'Mech has to do to grab a pod ua slide the connector inside and lock the "fingers" in place. This system, while even more versatile than the Clans' own omni-system, is more fragile and harder to use properly.

## GAME EFFECTS

Matches in Nashan's arena use the standard Battletech map sheets, placed side by side. No "Mech may exit the map as it is considered enclosed by high walls — the access doors are closed during the fights. Weapon pods (4, 8 and 16 combat) are scattered over the map. The exact number of pods depends on the scenario and should be decided by the players.

Placing them on the map should be done in a random manner; alternatively, one player gets to choose the setup and the other player gets his entry point.

Before the start of the match, each Mechwarrior must choose a software for the targeting computer, either Energy, Projectile, or Missile. This program allows weapons of the chosen type to be fired without penalty, all other types suffering a -1 to hit for lack of correct targeting software.

The QuickConnect™ system is a modified hand actuator, so it doesn't take any weight or space; it just fill up the critical normally allotted to the hand actuator. Should this actuator be destroyed, any pod carried is dropped immediately, and this arm cannot carry pods anymore.

The Mechwarrior can use the "hand" to pick up a weapon pod. This is done by stepping in the same hex as the pod and making a Piloting roll. If the roll succeeds, the pod is now safely attached to the Mech; if not, the pod remains on the ground and the pilot can try again next turn. No weapon fire is possible during the turn of the pick-up attempt, and all Piloting roll modifiers apply.

Only arms can use weapon pods. Each arm may carry up to half the total pod space available — both arms must be used to wield an 8-ton pod, for example. Because of the unstable connection, roll 1d6 each time the carrying arm is hit: on a roll of 1 or 2, the "hand" lets go and the pod falls on the ground. When carried, the pod and its contents are considered part of the arm for heat, damage and critical hit purpose. Two-handed arms split the criticals equally between the arms.

A "Mech can try to rip off a pod from its opponent. A functional hand actuator is necessary. Treat the attack as a punch with a -1 modifier; if successful, roll 1d6. The pod falls on the ground on 1-3 for one-handed pods, 1-2 for two-handed pods.

## CONCLUSION

For the moment, only the two arena "Mechs use the QuickConnect™ system. Although versatile, the system needs to be calibrated for many different kinds of weapons and is temperamental and prone to breakdowns. If the tests at the arena prove successful, Nashan intends to start manufacturing Battletechs equipped with the QuickConnect™ system in a few years.
