# MUSCATECH HOVER-TANK 'MECH

By Prabal Nandy

The invasion of the Clan — often signaled by the presence of incredibly fast light mechs with middle to assault class firepower — has prompted the use of much recovered Star League weapons and equipment in the Inner Sphere to bolster existing forces and to create new ones capable of fighting head-to-head with the technologically superior clans. Land Air Mechs (LAMS) capable of great speed for reconnaissance and hit-and-run attacks were seen as one way to even up the struggle against the Clans. Unfortunately, all hope of using LAMs for this cause was stifled when the Clans overran the IS's only LAM factory.

But now MUSCATechnology has come up with a worthy substitute to the LAM, the Hover-Tank Mech (HTM). The Hover-Tank Mech, using the extra speed resulting from the suspension factors of hovercraft, is able to cruise into battle at great speeds without the use of the volatile fuels that made LAMs so costly and hazardous to use. In addition, in the intermediate Gun Emplacement mode between Hover-Tank mode and Mech mode, the HTM becomes a stable, two legged fire support platform with -2 to hit modifiers with all weapons. Finally, when entering battle the HTM can transform into a 'mech for maximum battlefield resilience.

## CONSTRUCTION

A HTM can weigh up to 50 tons, with conversion machinery taking up 10% of that tonnage. This equipment includes the control system and fan units of the Hover-Tank mode. The engine rating and size (for 'Mech mode) is chosen and walking and running speeds are calculated as normal.

Cruise and flank speeds for Hover-Tank are calculated by adding in the Suspension Factor for the appropriate 'Mech tonnage listed in the SF table for hovercraft to the engine rating of the 'Mech, and then calculating cruise and flank per normal hovercraft rules. For example, a 40 ton, 7-11 HTM (280 engine rating), has an effective engine rating in Hovercraft mode of: 280 + 175(SF) = 455, giving it cruise and flank speeds of 11-17, a significant advantage. Round off the cruise speed to the nearest whole number if necessary.

In Gun Emplacement (GE) mode, the HTM has a movement of 1/3rd its Battletech movement rates (round off to nearest whole number — 2/3 in the case of the 7/11 vehicle above). Jumpjets may be mounted as normal for a Mech, and jumping ability is not affected in any of the transformation modes. Each intermediate transformation requires one turn.

Hover-Tank Mechs cannot carry MASC because of the special frame and myomers used in their construction. All other advanced construction systems and material can be used without restriction other than the normal space restrictions.

## FIRING AND DAMAGE

A HTM fires as normal in Mech mode. In Hover-Tank mode, the HTM's weapons fire as normal except that all weapons that usually fire in the forward arc of the 'Mech may now fire into the arm arcs as well. Effectively, the entire upper body of the Mech has become a huge limited-travel turret on top of the hip joint. In GE mode, the Mech retains this enhanced flexibility, in addition to a -2 modifier on all weapons due to the improved fire support base.

While in Mech or GE mode, the HTM uses the standard battlemode location table for assessing hits against it. While in Hover-Tank Mode the HTM uses a modified Hovercraft location table.

## DESIGNER'S NOTES

The VHT1AHTM is a design brainstormed by MUSCATech Advanced Systems engineers in response to the loss of Inner Sphere LAM production lines, loosely based on conceptual notes left in the computers of the UCCS Vergil prior launch. The engineers, recognizing a need for a new high speed assault vehicle that could combine aircraft-like speeds with the battlefield durability of a Mech platform developed a conversion system that allowed a Mech, through a LAM-like transformation, to convert into a Hover-Tank in order to use its unique movement characteristics.

The resulting 'Mech (only a small-scale prototype of which has been constructed) is able to approach a battlezone at high speed (Hover-Tank mode) and then convert into a Mech for conventional combat. The intermediate form, the Gun Emplacement mode, allows the VHT1AHTM to fulfill a guardian/defense role once territory has been occupied, where its stable firing platform allows it to easily target and destroy fast moving scout mechs.

The original design parameters of the VHT1AHTM called for a very general weapons complement. The main cannon of the VHT in Hover-Tank mode was to be the powerful Starstrike Extended Range PPC, able to attack long-range targets with potent firepower and no recoil. In Gun Emplacement mode, this weapon was to be complemented with a small laser triple cannon, mounted under a protective canopy in the left arm, ideal for attacking infantry and small mechs and benefiting from the GE mode's enhanced firing platform. Finally, in Mech mode, the VHT's firepower would be rounded out by a Ultra Autocannon-5 rifle carried in the right arm (requiring storage of the ER-PPC).

In anticipation of the VHT's rapid arrival on the battle scene, a TAG unit was added to the mech's head's sensor array to allow it to target for first-wave artillery barrages. Equipped with two wide-range, hard-hitting weapons the VHT would be able to engage targets in a wide variety of conditions and terrains, especially useful for the VHT's tactical mission as a long-range heavy interceptor.

## HOVER-TANK MODE HIT LOCATION TABLE

| Roll | Front/Back | Side (L/R) |
|------|------------|------------|
| 2    | CT (Crit) | LT/RT (Crit) |
| 3    | RL (Crit #1) | LA/RA |
| 4    | RL (Crit #2) | LL/RL (Crit #1) |
| 5    | RA | LL/RL (Crit #2) |
| 6    | RT | LA/RA |
| 7    | CT | LT/RT |
| 8    | LT | CT/CT |
| 9    | LA | RT/LT |
| 10   | LL (Crit #2) | RL/LL (Crit #2) |
| 11   | LL (Crit #1) | RA/LA |
| 12   | Head (Crit #3) | Head (Crit #3) |

The Hover-Tank table lists some special critical effects. None of these critical effects affect the HTM in 'Mech or GE mode.

## Critical Effect #1:
Make a piloting roll. A successful piloting roll results in the loss of 1MP (cruise), all others recalculated. A failed piloting roll results in the destruction of the HTM's hover jets causing a crash and skid per BTech skid rules. No further movement is possible for the HTM while in Hover-Tank Mode. Damage is taken as normal for the HTM in Hover-Tank mode.

## Critical Effect #2:
-1MP (cruise, all others recalculated.) due to damage to hoverers.

## Critical Effect #3:
Torso joint freezes. Forward arc weapons (including weapons on the arms) of the 'Mech may now only fire in the forward arc. When in 'Mech mode, the 'Mech may no longer torso twist.

Destruction of either leg while in Hover-Tank mode results in an immediate crash and skid.
