By Prabal Nandy

The VHT1AHTM is the first Hover-Tank Mech (HTM) designed to test the possibilities of the concept (see Design Notes, previous pages). The 'Mech is able to convert between three different modes: BattleMech, Gun Emplacement (GE) and Hover-Tank (HT), each with different speeds as listed. To save space, both Cruising and Flank speeds are replaced by the usual Walk and Run speeds. Note that the vehicle can use its jumpjets in a Hover-Tank mode, in that case, it acts like a normal jump-capable hover vehicle, with all restrictions applying.

The GE mode gives the HTM-2 the hit modifiers for all weapons because of the stable firing platform. Both HT and GE mode allow all weapons to be swiveled as if they were effectively on one turret firing in the torso and arm arcs. This turret is actually the torso rotating on its waist track.

Although it did well in the early testing runs, no regular production is scheduled for this 'Mech as at present. For the moment, the VHT1AHTM is simply considered a low-efficiency concept/testbed vehicle for later HTM projects.
