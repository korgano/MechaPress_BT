By Marc-Alexandre Vézina

Following the recent Mech-Press poll, we have decided to reintroduce a bit of Battletech in the magazine; so enjoy this adaptation of an old TV show called Walker Machine Xabungle!

Several mechs in Xabungle share the overall look of FASA's current designs. We chose to adapt the Dugger because it was a rugged design and was readily available as a model.

The very look suggested heavy armor and jump capacity; we decided to design it as a low-weight medium Mech to make it even more useful as there are few well armored medium in FASA's universe. The interesting thing about the basic design is that other than electronics and double-strength heat sinks, it does not use 3650 technology.

The Dugger is upgradable by replacing the whole left torso/arm assembly for close-in firepower and stealth. The best way to use the design is to use at least one of each model (A or B) in your force. Since they look exactly alike, you'll be able to confuse your opponent many times!
