# MUSCATECH 'MECH RIFLES

By Prabal Nandy

If nothing else, the invasion of the Clans in 3050 has demonstrated the usefulness and the need for dependable, modular weapons systems that can function both as tools of shock and surprise value, and as ways to minimize battlefield downtime due to weapon damage/malfunction.

It is for this reason that MUSCATech has invested considerable time and resources into the production of rifle upgrade kits, a method for Battlemechs to utilize interchangeable rifles on the battlefield, thereby altering their offensive firepower and allowing for easier repair and reloading of their weapons.

The following rules are totally optional and should be used only with the agreement of all players. They are considered Level 3 rules (as per the BattleTech Technical Handbook) and are thus not official in any way.

## RIFLES

Standard rifles generally come in 5, 10, 15, and 20-ton packages, though any regular arm-mounted weapon may be converted into a rifle by purchasing a rifle-upgrade kit at the following cost: Weapons Tonnage x 500 C-Bills. This in no way changes the performance of the weapon, but allows it to be interchanged on the field for a fresh rifle of the same size.

A rifle may carry any combination of weapons, ammunition, heat-sinks, or armor. All ammo-fed weapons must carry at least one ton of ammunition within the rifle itself (i.e., a 'Mech's internal ammo stores may **not** feed a rifle). Ammunition for weapons not contained in the rifle, electronics gear, C3 units, or anti-missile systems may **not** be contained within a rifle. TAG equipment, however, may be included in a rifle. Artemis FCS or Narc Beacons can be mounted on a rifle, but may be used only for missile weapons contained within that rifle.

Heatsinks may be added to a rifle to make up for some of its generated heat. The heatsinks must be of the same type as that of the 'Mech carrying the rifle, otherwise they are rendered nonfunctional.

## REQUIREMENTS

To be fitted for a rifle, a 'Mech must allocate critical spaces in its arm locations as for a normal weapons combination. The 'Mech may **not** remove any of its arm actuators to make further room for the rifle. Therefore, the maximum amount of room a rifle may occupy is 8 Critical Spaces. The 'Mech may place its full compliment of armor on its arm, but must allocate free tonnage equal to the weight of its rifle to be able to use it (as for a normal weapon).

The 'Mech's hand actuator is taken up by sensitive rifle interfacing equipment and is designed for holding and replacing rifles only. It cannot be used to pick up objects and can only be used to punch with a +1 hit modifier. Any 'Mech that uses a rifle must be equipped with this equipment, which costs 5000 C-Bills per modified hand actuator.

Any 'Mech that has a functioning hand actuator and wishes to use a rifle may do so, but with a +2 hit modifier for the weapons mounted on that rifle.

## HITS AND DAMAGE

Hits on an arm location are treated as normal. The rifle is considered protected by the surrounding armor of the arm, and no special modification of the rules is necessary regarding its critical armor. Rifles that contain additional armor for the arm location have their armor deducted first, before damage penetrates to the 'Mech's arm. The damage is treated as if solely done to the armor of the rifle. Ammunition detonation occurs as normal, doing damage to the arm carrying the rifle and then to the rest of the 'Mech as appropriate. Hits to the 'Mech's arm actuators create penalties for the use of the rifle as normal, but a hit to the 'Mech's hand actuator damages the rifle interface machinery and therefore has the added effect of making it impossible for the 'Mech to use or drop the rifle it is currently carrying.

## USE OF RIFLES

For all normal battle purposes, weapons and attacks launched by a rifle are treated as for standard arm-mounted weapons.

At any point in the battle, if the Mech's interfacing hand actuator is still operational, the Mech may elect to drop its rifle. This procedure takes 1 round to execute, during which the weapons mounted on the rifle may not be fired. The rifle falls into the hex the Mech is standing in when the drop round was completed. If before the end of the weapons firing phase, the dropping operation is jammed midway, and the rifle may not be fired or dropped for the duration of the battle. If a 'Mech's arm has been blown off during battle (and the hand actuator has not been hit specifically), the rifle that was carried in that arm is considered dropped and may be picked up as for a regular rifle.

At any point in the battle, a 'Mech may elect to pick up a rifle. Picking up a rifle requires two rounds (during which the Mech must remain within the hex that the rifle was in, though it may make facing changes), and **two** functioning hand actuators (one of which must be equipped with a rifle interface). Since the rifle interface carrying hand may not lift objects, it is highly suggested that 'Mechs do not equip both hand actuators with rifle interfaces, which would prevent a 'Mech from being able to pick up a rifle.

In addition, at the end of the two rounds (prior to the next movement phase), the Mech must make a 6 or better on a 2D6 for a to-drop roll. If the roll fails, the rifle falls back into the original hex that it was in. Only upgraded rifles may be picked up. Regular rifles, such as the ones used by *Stingers*, *Battlemasters* or other 3025 Mechs are fused to the arm and may not be removed during battles.

## RELOADING

At any point in the battle, a 'Mech may elect to reload ammunition clips for its ammo-fed weapons. Ammo clips may be carried as internal or external cargo. They may not be used for on-board weaponry, but otherwise there are no penalties for clipped ammunition. This requires **two** functioning hand actuators, and three rounds during which none of the weapons on the rifle may fire. After reload, a loading roll of 4 or better on a 2D6 must be made for the ammunition to have been reloaded properly. If the roll fails, the ammunition jams and the ammo that fed from it is rendered nonfunctional for the duration of the battle.

## MOVEMENT MODIFIERS

If a 'Mech picks up a rifle of the same size (tonnage) as the rifle it is "fitted" for, it may use it with no penalty. If a 'Mech uses a rifle of size larger than that it was outfitted for, its speed is reduced as follows:

Engine rating + ('Mech tonnage [w/o rifle]) + rifle tonnage = new Walking speed, rounded up.

A lighter rifle does not confer any special speed bonus. If necessary, the maximum jumping range should be reduced to remain equal to the new Walking speed.

Example: A Stinger outfitted with a rifle upgrade drops its Medium Laser Rifle (spending 1 round) to pick up a modified Phoenix Hawk's ER Large Laser rifle. This procedure requires two rounds, after which the Stinger's speed is reduced to 5-8-5.

120 Engine+ (20 tons - 1 ton + 5 tons).

After the two rounds, the Stinger may fire the ERLL normally.

If the Stinger had not been equipped with an upgraded hand actuator, or if it had carried the ERLL in its non-modified left hand, it would have had a +2 to hit modifier for the ERLL in addition to the speed loss.

If the Stinger had decided to pick up a modified Wolverine's Ultra AC-5 rifle (10 tons) instead of the ERLL, its speed would have been reduced to 4-6-4.

## ARM-STABILIZED WEAPONS

'Mechs with rifle-mounted weaponry may choose to stabilize that weapon for firing with a free arm, giving them a -1 to hit (with the stabilized weapon only). For example, a Griffin may choose to stabilize its right-arm mounted PPC with its left arm, minimizing vibrations and thereby making aiming easier.

To stabilize a weapon, the player must first designate a single arm weapon to stabilize. The weapon will be supported by the opposing arm, which may not fire any of its weapons or conduct physical attacks during that attack phase. All arm actuators must be present and undamaged on the stabilizing arm. The stabilized weapon then gains a -1 to hit for the turn it is fired stabilized.

Arm weapons firing into side arcs may not be stabilized.
