The need for additional combat units to use against the Clans has caused several old designs to be pressed back into service, hastily refurbished with new technology. Among these, the venerable 3025-tech *Griffin* was an excellent candidate for the new rifle actuator update, since it already used a primitive form of the concept to mount its right arm PPC.

The GRF-1RU's basic structure remains unchanged. It is still powered by the reliable and efficient CoreTek fusion engine which contributed to the success of the "classic trio": *Wolverine*, *Shadow Hawk* and *Griffin*. Likewise, the LRM 10 launcher is still present on the right shoulder, ready to provide long range firepower.

The most radical change lies in the machine's right forearm. An all-new assembly is manufactured separately and shipped to front-line units and garrisons, where they simply exchange the old one for the rifle-riding model. The whole operation can even take place on the field, provided a friendly 'Mech with hands is ready to assist.

Three standard rifle models already exist, though new designs will doubtlessly be available in the coming months. There are rumored to be over-weight missile rifles to transform the 'Mech into a fire support vehicle, but the loss of speed and the additional strain on the frame will probably discourage potential users.
