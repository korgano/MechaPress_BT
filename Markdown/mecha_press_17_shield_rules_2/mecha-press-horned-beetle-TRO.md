By Marc A. Vezina and Normand Bilodeau

The *Horned Beetle* is a proposed test-bed for many of the new systems currently being studied by the engineers of MUSCATech, Ltd. The presence of twin shields, one on each arm, would make this machine an excellent close-in fighter capable of surviving awesome amounts of damage.

The left hand carries a large "tower"-type shield which can be used to protect vulnerable parts of the Battlemech as it closes in with its opponents. A smaller "buckler" shield defends the right arc, especially the head unit. Finally, an anti-missile system takes care of any incoming missile flight.

The armament reflects the close combat role of the machine. The large lasers provide some long range firepower while still being usable in close fighting. The twin medium lasers and the hip-mounted SRM launchers are the main punch at short range, with a wicked hatchet as the final *coup de grace* weapon.
