# BATTLETECH SHOW OVERVIEW

By Marc A. Vezina

In late 1993, FASA Corporation started work on an ambitious new project: an animated TV series based on the Battletech universe. Battletech was FASA's great success, a decade-old space opera of epic proportions. Millions of words have been published about it through several media such as games, novels, software, etc., and the storyline covers nearly 30 years of active, ongoing history. It was time for Battletech to make the leap to mainstream media.

The design team had two main objectives in mind. They wanted to keep the show true to the existing Battletech universe, yet, they needed to produce a show that would appeal to the uninitiated viewer, most likely younger than the average Battletech player. This would inevitably bring some conflict that called for innovative solutions.

To meet these goals, a set of criteria was laid down. The team had to keep the story's focus on manageable proportions, else the sheer amount of detail would only confuse the new public. Good guys and bad guys had to be clearly established from the start—with twenty minutes long episodes, there is no time to explain who is "good" or "evil" every week. Finally, although the series was to be firmly based on the existing Battletech material, the writers had to be given some leeway when creating the storyline.

To prepare the show, the design team used the same method FASA uses when commissioning novels: one person drafts the novels for the major events (what FASA calls an "umbrella" novel—like the Warrior Trilogy) and all subsequent novels and material detail it by filling in smaller events. In the case of the animated series, they treated the whole Battletech line as the umbrella.

Then they developed the storyline and characters. The bad guys were easy: a Crusader Clan was the perfect choice—in this case, the Jade Falcon Clan. Their single-minded purpose and alien mindset made them wonderful villains for the show. Creating the Inner Sphere opposition was more difficult. The team tried several variations: raiders, mercenaries, etc., before settling on the 1st Somerset Strikers. By setting the story at the beginning of the war in just one invasion corridor, the team limited the protagonists to just these two sides. Adding the multi-national Jumpship crew showed the animosity between the major Houses and their subsequent changes in attitude. Finally, by making the main character a distant relative of the Steiner ruling family, the design team could give the viewer a taste of Inner Sphere politics.

The basic premise was then turned over to the teleplay writers, Bob Skir and Marty Lenberg. They crafted a story about the Strikers' quest to retake their captured home planet, Somerset. Over the course of the show, they would discover who and what the Clans are, and overcoming their distrust of one another, unite as allies against the invader. At the same time, the Claners would become divided by petty ambition and outright hatred as they clash with the Inner Sphere forces.

While the writers hammered out the storyline, the rest of the team made various visual design choices. They exaggerated the differences between the Strikers and the Clans to communicate the alienness and power of the Clans. The team felt it would be more efficient than having the Strikers spend an episode explaining how different the Clans are from the Inner Sphere.

To show the Jade Falcon's unity and discipline, the designers gave them tight-fitting uniforms that never seem to get dirty or worn. In contrast, the Inner Sphere characters all wear a motley collection of baggy, ripped and frayed clothes that need a good wash. To further differentiate the Clanners, they gave them weird haircuts and tattoos.

The facial tattoos served another purpose; they allowed the introduction of computer graphics in the show. The fictional rationalization for what had become known as Enhanced Imaging already existed in the game module **Unbound**. The tattoos became neural pick-up circuitry that replaced the neuro-helment and allowed the Clanners impressive control over their machines. By making the system dangerous and assuming that only the youngest, most aggressive warriors use it, the team connected it with previous fiction without major breaks in continuity.

The last big choices made concerned the Battlemechs used in the show. Although hundreds of models already exist in the time frame available, only so many could be modeled in the computer in the time frame available. A few existing 'Mechs were selected and modified as needed, and a couple more show-specific machines were added. The choices represented a few storyline compromises in the background and appearance of the individual 'Mech. The best example of this is the infamous *Mauler*, which is according to the **Technical Readout 3050**, a Kurita top-secret prototype. Yet, in the animation it seems that everybody operates one, even Federated Commonwealth soldiers! (See the *Mecha Files* for more explanations.)

After the story line and general look of the show had been approved, existing 'Mechs and characters were reexamined and modified by Jordan Weisman, Charlie Fink and Kaaren Brown. Show producer Kurt Weldon and his staff generated models for all the characters, Battlemechs and setting. Scripts were worked out using events and plot hooks from existing **Battletech** material.

Many such plot hooks came from the novels and adventure modules. For example, Franklin Sakamoto came from Bob Chester's **Heir to the Dragon**, Ciro Ramirez was from Mike Stackpole's **Lethal Heritage**, and the escape of Victor Steiner-Davion was also featured in this novel. The SLDF military base known as Camelot Command was from the **Rhonda Snord's Irregulars** game module.

Some changes were made in the convention of normal **Battletech** reality to keep the show moving and conform to the limitation of the media. Entire planets were fought over by a handful of 'Mechs instead of complete battalions. Somerset fell in the first invasion wave rather than the second, and was "liberated" at the end of the first season. 'Mech battles had to be kept short and simple — however, this provided the opportunity to show the Clanners' superiority by having them dispatch enemy 'Mechs with one or two shots.

The characters and events of the animated series will be feeding back into the **BattleTech** fiction. The aging Clan warrior Pytor is seen in Bob Thurton's **I am Jade Falcon** novel, and Adam Steiner and Co. will be making cameo appearance in future **Battletech** novels and products. The 1st Somerset Strikers are now part of the Clan universe, ready to carry on the fight against the Clan invaders.

## BATTLETECH CHARACTERS

**ADAM STEINER**

Rank: Major

A distant relative of the Steiner family, Adam Steiner is a native of the Federated Commonwealth world of Somerset. He graduated from honors on the Somerset Academy and was invited to become an instructor at the prestigious Nagelring Military Academy because of his innovative tactical skills. When the Clans captured Somerset, Adam formed a combat unit to liberate his home planet. He managed to get the equipment he needed by promising the Archon to do double-duty by gathering information on the Clan invader.

The combination of earning his current rank at his young age, his illustrious name and his lack of combat experience force him to work harder to prove himself to the soldiers under his command. As time passes and his multiple abilities are revealed, Adam manages to win the respect and admiration of the members of his motley combat unit.

**ZACHARY MILES HAWKINS**

Rank: Major

"Hawk" Hawkins is a veteran Mechwarrior who has seen more combat than most people live to tell about. He now takes on special assignments for the Federated Commonwealth. Born on the world of Ryde, Hawk rose through the ranks through sheer dedication and hard work. He distrusts leaders who got their rank by social position and is initially distrustful of young Steiner's ability to command the unit.

Although his work took him everywhere in the Inner Sphere, Hawk remains close to his family. Gruff but good-natured, he values his comradeship with his fellow soldiers. He often takes upon himself to restore order in the unit, and his abilities as peacemaker are often tested to the limit by the Strikers.

**VALTEN RYDER**

Rank: Captain

A talented Mechwarrior, "Val" Ryder is a loveable scoundrel with a shady past. Rather than join the Commonwealth's army as seven generations of Ryders did, he became a mercenary. He joined a small unit called Monk's Marauders and spent a few years knocking around the Inner Sphere with his father's Battlemech, a serviceable Centurion. However, he soon ended up owing a lot of money to the wrong people, eventually working for a crime boss named Tybus on the planet Dustball to get his 'Mech back.

The Strikers were his one chance of escaping his debt-filled life, and he leapt at it. Though cocky, flashy and a bit selfish, Val would never let his fellow warriors down. Val has the boundless confidence of a smooth operator who takes the lowest put-down as a flirtatious comment.

**RACHEL SPECTER**

Rank: Lieutenant

As the tactical operations officer of the Strikers, Rachel Specter occupies a unique position in the FedCom military. Together, she and Adam Steiner developed a tactical strategy based on constant information gathering. In effect, she is the Strikers' eyes and ears in battle. She is an expert at sorting out battle data and other useful information out of a mass of seemingly random signals.

Like Adam, Rachel trained at the Somerset Academy where they grew to be close friends. As they served together, they became even closer, much like brother and sister, each sharing their innermost thoughts with the other. No one knows why she always wears a glove on her right hand. Members of the unit postulate that she glides holes scars from an old incident that she is reluctant to talk about.

**CIRO RAMIREZ**

Rank: Lieutenant/Mechwarrior

The son of a minor noble, Ciro is an arrogant idealist with unfortunate convictions. While he values courage and honor, he refuses to see these qualities in anyone not born of a good family. When the world proved him otherwise, he compensated by clinging even harder to his convictions. He idolizes the lost Star League, seeing it as the perfect society where the wise nobility ruled over the vast mass of lesser humanity. His most precious possession is a Star League Order of the Star Medal given by General Kerensky to one of his ancestors.

After his graduation — he was in the same class as Victor Steiner-Davion — he was assigned to training duty under Adam Steiner. Deeply hurt by this perceived slight of his abilities as a warrior, Ciro carries a constant grudge against the Strikers and the Federated Commonwealth in general.

**KATIANA KYLIE**

Rank: Cadet

Kate Kylie always wanted to fly. Growing up in a small Somerset town, she demonstrated early exceptional reflexes and an amazing natural talent for piloting. Though she dearly loved her home and family, she wanted to travel, and so enlisted in the army of the Federated Commonwealth. She found herself at the Nagelring where she became the student of another Somerset native, Major Adam Steiner.

Young, brash and eager, Kyle is a brilliant aerojock and a commander’s nightmare. She just loves danger and is very impulsive. Emotional and intense, she’ll rather act *now*. When she was refused a place in the newly-formed Somerset Strikers, Kyle forged false orders to get aboard regardless. She only avoided a court-martial by saving the unit from an unlikely demise.

**FRANKLIN SAKAMOTO**

Rank: none

Franklin is the illegitimate son of Warlord Theodore Kurita and an ISF agent named Kathleen Palmer. His life has been filled by danger and intrigues ever since his early childhood. Rescued from certain death by a group opposed to the present rulers of the Combine, he was hidden and raised as a normal child until deemed ready to claim his heritage. Unfortunately for the group, Franklin chose to remain loyal to his father, rejected the rebel alliance and renounced all claims to the throne.

His association with the Strikers has changed him profoundly. He learned that old stereotypes cannot be accurately applied to the whole Federated Commonwealth. Intensely disciplined, loyal and honorable, Franklin is a dangerous enemy and a strong ally. The Strikers have seen both sides and much prefer to be called friends.

**ERNEST “PATCH” McGUIRE**

Technician

“Patch” McGuire is one of the rare people apparently born with a natural affinity for machinery of any type. An experiment with an air-conditioning unit in his youth left him with his nickname and turned him into an enthusiastic tinkerer.

Patch enjoys the warriors’ friendly bidding for his service, although he often has to remind them that he can only work on one machine at a time. He derives a great deal of glee by constantly tinkering with the unit’s BattleMech and Jumpship every time he is required to perform a repair.

**NICOLAI MALTHUS**

Rank: Star Colonel

Jade Falcon scientists created Nicolai from the best genetic material at their disposal, intent on creating the most fearsome warrior the universe had ever seen. Their efforts seemed destined to succeed when Nicolai excelled in all trials to which he was submitted. He soon emerged as a natural leader, although his arrogance prevented him from forming any close ties with his sibkins.

Following his graduation, he quickly rose through the rank, driven by a ruthless ambition. He soon secured a Bloodrune and the command of the elite Falcon’s Claws. He seemed destined to best his long-time rival, Star Colonel Kristen Redmond, until he met the Strikers and faced defeat for the first time by "barbarians". Since then, as the Inner Sphere unit continues to best him, his determination to destroy the and regain his honor is turning into a deadly obsession that threatens to devour him.

**PYTOR**

Rank: Star Commander 

At thirty-seven years old, Pytor is a “useless old man” by Clan standards. As an experienced warrior, he is nonetheless considered past his fighting prime and viewed with contempt by his fellow warriors and his commander, Nicolai Mathius. Mathius pays Pytor scant respect, and Pytor’s wise counsels often fall on deaf ears.

Though his pride still makes him carry out his orders to the best of his abilities, Pytor is no longer sure there is any point in doing so. A confused man trying to define the true meaning of honor in a society that has betrayed him, he must decide whether to cling blindly to his old ideals or find a new truth he has barely begun to suspect.

**KRISTEN REDMOND**

Rank: Star Colonel 

A brilliant fighter and tactician, Kristen Redmond is a true Clan warrior. She controls her reckless streak well enough not to take foolish chances. She knows when to gamble and when not to. The only real flaw in her character is her on-going feud with the Falcon’s Claws’ commander, Nicolai Mathius. In recent months, this bitter rivalry has led her to confuse personal and Clan honors more than once.

Shrewd, calculating, and fiercely proud, Kristen rarely backs down once she has committed to a course of action. A bold and tenacious fighter, she accepts defeat only if the good of the Clans requires it, and even then regards such losses as mere setbacks.

**NATALYA**

Rank: Star Commander 

Star Commander Natalya is intensely loyal to her commanding officer, Nicolai Mathius, in part because she sees Mathius' exploits as the best shot at battlefield glory. Natalya wants nothing more than to win a Bloodname, and at twenty-four years, she feels her time is running out. This makes her a bloodthirsty adversary at all times.

As a Clan Elemental, Natalya is large and extremely strong. She is proud of her strength and fighting skills and dreams of passing them on to the next generation of Falcon warriors. She is willing to do anything, no matter how reckless, to ensure her place in the Clans’ future.

## NEW TECHNOLOGY

**Enhanced Information**

The information gathered by a Battlemech's sensor array is usually displayed on a 180° display located in front of the pilot, with visual cues being provided by a head-up display (HUD). The Clans have done better by incorporating a virtual-reality type visualization system that aggregate battlefield intelligence into a cohesive, real-time tactical display. The Clans' advanced sensor arrays allow them to use this system to strike more accurately and at a longer range.

**EI Neural Implant**

A few of the Clan warriors encountered in the first waves of the invasion sported what first appeared to be complex tattoos on their face and upper body. It was later discovered that these tattoos were in fact a neural interface system that completely replaced the more primitive neuro-helmet. The neural implants work in conjunction with the standard Enhanced Imaging display, allowing the MechWarrior to access his Mech's systems by thoughts. Naturally, the systems work only on humanoid vehicles such as BattleMechs or Battle Armors.

Only the most fanatical elements of the Clans use this system however, since it has dangerous and painful side-effects. This feedback shock from battle damage can severely injure or even kill the pilot by overloading his nervous system. About 5% of all Clan Mechwarriors use the implant, although since they tend to work with one another the proportion may seem higher to some observers. Implanted warriors are mostly found among Crusader Clans such as the Jade Falcons and the Smoke Jaguars.

### Tactical Operation Center
The Tactical Operation Center (TOC hereafter) serves as the "brain" of a Battlemech combat unit. Lieutenant Specter has made several improvements to the Strikers' TOC, including a network communication system that allows her to interface the TOC with satellites, Dropships, aerospace fighters, distant JumpShips and Battlemechs simultaneously. Advanced cryptography algorithms ensure that the transmissions remain indecipherable to the enemy.

The information gathered by the TOC's sensors and those of the vehicles interfaced with it are downloaded into the TOC's powerful battle computer, which then proceeds to construct a real-time, complete image of the situation, sorting the useful information from the garbage. The tactical officer managing the TOC (usually Specter herself) can then make appropriate suggestions to the field commander, allowing him to respond more rapidly to the battlefield's everchanging conditions.

**AXM-2N AXMAN**

![BattleTech Cartoon Axman Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_01.png "BattleTech Cartoon Axman Lineart")

The *Axman* is a development of the very successful Hatchetman BattleMech. Like its smaller brother, it was designed by the famous Dr. Banzai and is equipped with a 'Mech-sized battleaxe. Early prototypes of the *Axman* carried a large autocannon placed in the right torso, with the engine displaced to the left. Chronic jamming problems left the engineers no choice but to replace the autocannon with two packs of long range missiles. Adam's machine is one of the first of these new models.

- Mass: 65 tons
- Maximum Speed: 64 kph
- Maximum Jump: 120 meters
- Armor Factor: 179
- Weapons: Long Range Missiles/15 x 2, Large Pulse Laser x 1, Medium Pulse Laser x 3, Hatchet x 1

**MAL-1R MAULER**

![BattleTech Cartoon Mauler Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_02.png "BattleTech Cartoon Mauler Lineart")

First thought to be only a prototype, the Kurita *Mauler* proved that its development was a lot more rapid than expected. Significant numbers of *Mauler*s were already in service in 3038 and fought the war of 3039 against the Federated Commonwealth. Many units were captured by the FedCom soldiers, and the design made its way into the hands of the AFFC. However, lack of spare parts and trained technicians exiled the *Mauler* to far-away planets, which, ironically, were right in the path of the Clans' invasion corridors. *Mauler*s were operated by many characters in the animation, most notably Hawk, Franklin, and even Victor Steiner-Davion.

- Mass: 90 tons
- Maximum Speed: 54 kph
- Armor Factor: 206
- Weapons: Extended Range Large Laser x 2, Long Range Missiles/15 x 2, Autocannon/2 x 4

**AWESOME**

![BattleTech Cartoon Awesome Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_03.png "BattleTech Cartoon Awesome Lineart")

The *Awesome* is one of the best known Assault-class Battlemechs. Its PPC array, while generating large amounts of heat, can deliver a lethal volley at long range. Although the *Awesome* is heavily armored, its new XL powerplant allows it to keep up with the rest of the unit. The Strikers' *Awesome* is extensively modified by Rachel to serve as a mobile command post. It is normally used by Adam.

- Mass: 80 tons
- Maximum Speed: 65.4 kph
- Armor Factor: 206
- Weapons: Extended Range Particle Projection Cannon x 3, Small Laser x 1, Command Console x 1

**BSM-X1 BUSHWACKER**

![BattleTech Cartoon Bushwacker Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_04.png "BattleTech Cartoon Bushwacker Lineart")

The *Bushwacker* was originally designed to provide a smaller frontal silhouette to the enemy, but shielding problems in its elongated torso scraped the project. When information about the Clans' *Vulture* was brought back by the Strikers, the engineers used its shielding technology to complete the *Bushwacker*. The machine boasts a varied arsenal capable of striking at several ranges. Currently, the Strikers have only one *Bushwacker* which is normally piloted by Val.

- Mass: 55 tons
- Maximum Speed: 80 kph
- Armor Factor: 120
- Weapons: Extended Range Large Laser x 1, LB 10-X Autocannon x 1, Long Range Missiles/5 x 2, Machinegun x 1

**WLF-2 WOLFHOUND**

![BattleTech Cartoon Wolfhound Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_05.png "BattleTech Cartoon Wolfhound Lineart")

The *Wolfhound* was the Steiner's answer to the Kurita Panther light Mech and was extensively tested in the Fourth Succession War. Built by one of the most respected factories in the Federated Commonwealth, the *Wolfhound* has started appearing in large numbers in the FedCom armed forces. Equipped solely with energy-based weaponry, this Mech has excellent endurance. Ciro and Andrew Steiner piloted *Wolfhound*s in the animation.

- Mass: 35 tons
- Maximum Speed: 95 kph
- Armor Factor: 120
Weapons: Extended Range Large Laser x 1, Medium Laser x 4

**BSE-X2 BANSHEE**

![BattleTech Cartoon Banshee Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_06.png "BattleTech Cartoon Banshee Lineart")

The *Banshee* is the first of a new generation of aerospace fighters designed with recovered Star League technology. Exceptional ergonomics allow the pilot to take more G force in combat than usual, while special thruster actuators and atmospheric engines enable the *Banshee* to perform as either an aerospace fighter, a conventional fighter or a VTOL vehicle. The cost of such versatility is payload: the fighter is only armed with lasers. The 1st Somerset Strikers currently have two *Banshee*s, one piloted by Kylie and the other either by Adam or Franklin.

Mass: 50 tons
Maximum Speed: 1440 kph (VTOL capable)
Armor Factor: 74
Weapons: Medium Laser x 2

**HATAMOTO-CHI**

![BattleTech Cartoon Hatamoto-Chi Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_07.png "BattleTech Cartoon Hatamoto-Chi Lineart")

This powerful Kurita Mech is a development of the ill-fated *Charger*, which was designed as an 80-ton scout. By reducing the machine's speed, Kuritan engineers managed to load more weapons and armor onto the frame than before, creating a new Battlemech in the process. The 'Mech has several variants, denoted by the suffix placed after *Hatamoto*. Franklin uses a *Hatamoto-Chi* in episode 11.

Mass: 80 tons
Maximum Speed: 64 kph
Armor Factor: 247
Weapons: Particle Projection Cannon x 2, Short Range Missiles/6 x 2

**HUNCHBACK IIC**

![BattleTech Cartoon Hunchback IIC Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_08.png "BattleTech Cartoon Hunchback IIC Lineart")

This Battlemech's basic design has remained largely unchanged since the days of the Star League. The Clans have modified the 'Mech's payload to a large extent using thier advanced technology, adding another heavy autocannon and five jump jets. However, the Mech is lightly armored for its weight class and does not carry enough ammunition to be useful in a prolonged battle. For this reason, it is relegated to older or freeborn Clan warriors. Pytor pilots a *Hunchback IIC* in the animation.

Mass: 50 tons
Maximum Speed: 63.5 kph
Maximum Jump: 120 meters
Armor Factor: 96
Weapons: Ultra Autocannon/20 x 2, Extended Range Medium Laser x 2

**THOR-M (SUMMONER-M)**

![BattleTech Cartoon Summoner-M Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_09.png "BattleTech Cartoon Summoner-M Lineart")

The *Thor* is one of the favorite 'Mechs of Clan Jade Falcon. It is an excellent all-around machine, capable of delivering damage over a wide range of ranges with little heat. It is quite mobile for a machine of its weight class and very flexible. The *Thor* is one of the tallest Omnimechs currently in use. It is theorized that this extends the range of the head-mounted sensor blister. It exists in a variety of configurations. The *Thor*-M is equipped with a direct neural interface and is the 'Mech of choice of Star Colonel Nicolai Malthus. Malthus's personal Omnimech is painted blood red.

Mass: 70 tons
Maximum Speed: 86.4 kph
Maximum Jump: 150 meters
Armor Factor: 182

Weapons: LB 10-X Autocannon x 1, Extended Range Projectile Cannon x 1, Short Range Missiles x 1

**C99-D CENTURION**

![BattleTech Cartoon Centurion Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_10.png "BattleTech Cartoon Centurion Lineart")

A sturdy medium 'Mech, the *Centurion* was a good candidate for recovered technology applications. The updated version mounts a powerful LB 10-X Autocannon in its right arm while its long range missiles are made more accurate by the Artemis IV guidance system. The *Centurion*'s reliability makes it popular with military commanders, and the design is often seen in the AFFC. Val's personal Battlemech is a *Centurion*.

Mass: 50 tons
Maximum Speed: 90.7 kph
Armor Factor: 136

Weapons: LB 10-X Autocannon x 1, Medium Pulse Laser x 2, Long Range Missiles/10 x 1

**VULTURE (MAD DOG)**

![BattleTech Cartoon Mad Dog Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_11.png "BattleTech Cartoon Mad Dog Lineart")

Its hunched appearance and birdlike legs earned the *Vulture* its nickname in two different places at once. A combination of long range missiles and large and medium lasers make it an effective fighter at all ranges. The *Vulture* is similar to the *Mad Cat*, sharing all of its lower torso and many of its upper torso components with the heavier machine. In all combat situations observed, this 'Mech has proven to be a tough, effective fighter. Star Colonel Kristen Redmond pilots a blue and green *Vulture* throughout the animated series.

Mass: 60 tons
Maximum Speed: 86.4 kph
Armor Factor: 163

Weapons: Large Pulse Laser x 2, Medium Pulse Laser x 2, Long Range Missiles/20 x 1

**MAD CAT (TIMBER WOLF)**

![BattleTech Cartoon Timber Wolf Lineart](/Markdown/Images/mecha_press_17_mech_12.png "BattleTech Cartoon Timber Wolf Lineart")

The *Mad Cat* was the first OmniMech encountered by the Inner Sphere. Named *Timber Wolf* by the Clans, the 'Mech was assigned the codename *Mad Cat* because of its appearance, which resembles both the *Marauder* and Catapult Battlemechs. The *Mad Cat* is fast, well-armed, and heavily armored. With an extensive heat sink complement, it rarely overheats and as such is a ferocious fighter. *Mad Cat*s are often seen in the animation; Ciro pilots one in the last few episodes.

Mass: 75 tons
Maximum Speed: 86.4 kph
Armor Factor: 230

Weapons: Extended Range Large Laser x 2, Extended Range Medium Laser x 2, Extended Range Small Laser x 1, Medium Pulse Laser x 1, Long Range Missiles/20 x 2, Machine Gun x 2
