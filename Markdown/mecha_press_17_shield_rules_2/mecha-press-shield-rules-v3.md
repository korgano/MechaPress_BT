# MUSCATech SHIELDS

By Prabal Nandy

```
This is actually the third set of shield rules for Battletech published in Mecha Press (the first was found in MP1, while the second was in MP10). While the first attempt was poorly received, the second one fared better and was much more playable. This third set is part of a larger series of articles (as indicated by its "MUSCATech" header) and so is published here. Players may choose which rules they use, or even mix them. As usual, these home rules are considered Level 3 rules and are not official in any way.

## SHIELDS

Any 'Mech may carry a shield on either or both of its arms. A shield may carry as much as double the maximum allowable armor points of the arm carrying it. For example, a 30 ton 'Mech has 5 pts of internal structure in each of its arms. The maximum amount of armor allowed on the arm is therefore 10 pts. A shield added to this arm can therefore have up to 20 pts of armor.

## USAGE

The shield always protects the arm it is mounted on on the front hit table. I.e., any hit to the shielded arm assessed on the front side hit table hits the shield instead. The shield takes full damage from the hits until it is destroyed or knocked off, at which point the 'Mech's arm takes the damage normally. The shield does not protect the arm from hits assessed on the side or rear hit tables.

The shield may also be used to temporarily protect a torso region. At the start of any movement turn, the Player may announce his use of the shield. Assuming the shield is on the right arm, the Player may elect to use the shield to protect the Right Torso, or the Right and Center Torso (the Right Arm is still protected by the shield). Likewise, a shield on the left arm may be used to shield the Left torso, or the Left and Center Torso. Any hit to these locations on the front and side torso hit location tables is assessed against the shield's armor. The shield does not protect rear torso or arm locations. Note that it is not possible to defend only the center torso, the arm-ward side torso section must also be defended.

If a 'Mech is mounted with two shields, the shields may not be used to overlap on the Center Torso.

A shield may be destroyed or removed in two ways. A shield may be destroyed when its armor is completely depleted (with remaining damage going to the hit locations normally), or when the hand actuator of the shield-carrying arm is hit. (Ex: If the 'Mech is attacked from the rear, and weapons hits penetrate the arm armor, doing a critical on the hand actuator location which is "engaged" holding the shield.) In this second case, the shield is "dropped" and may be reattached after the battle.

## FIRING EFFECTS

No protected location may fire its weapons (in the defended arcs) while the shield is in use defending it. Therefore, the 'Mech carrying the shield (though it is allowed to carry weapons) may not fire them in the forward arc while the shield is still attached. Likewise, while a torso is being defended, it may not fire any of its weapons into the forward firing arc.

## SHIELD REQUIREMENTS

A shield contains up to double the maximum amount of armor allowed on the arm carrying it. The extra armor for the shield must therefore be purchased in half ton lots, though armor may be "taken" off other locations of the 'Mech and allocated to the shield as well. (I.e., the shield does not have to be "purchased" separately from the rest of the armor of the 'Mech, so therefore extra armor points that would have been wasted on the 'Mech after maxing out of armor can be used on the shield.)

The shield requires the hand actuator of the Mech, which must be present and unoccupied. Shields are therefore incompatible with MUSCATech rifles (see previous issue) for that arm. A hit to the hand critical location causes the shield to be dropped into the Mech's hex, and all subsequent hits to apply as normal to the Mech's arm.

Shields may be voluntarily dropped at the start of a movement phase, though they may not be reattached on the battlefield.

## OPTIONAL ADVANCED SHIELD RULES

These rules modify the rules above by accounting for three general forms of shields, and their unique properties. The rules listed above apply to all shields except where indicated. The generic, hand-carried shield described above will now be referred to as a Tower shield; it is presented here for comparison purposes.

The only physical difference between these forms of shields is their critical slot placement on the 'Mech. One critical slot is taken per shield, and only one shield is allowed per arm. Destruction of the shield's critical location causes the shield to fall off the Mech's arm, removing all armor located on that shield from the arm.

Like standard shields, both Binders and Bucklers take the damage assessed to the 'Mech's arms before it passes on to the arm proper, after the destruction of the shield. Bucklers have the additional property that hits that would normally be assessed against the head from a left or right side-attack are absorbed by the buckler. Binders, due to their placement of the Mech's forearm, may not defend the center torso However, every binder has the ability to stow up to two MUSCAtech modular riles (see Mecha Press #16) behind it. These stowed rifles are automatically destroyed once the armor of the binder is penetrated, however.

If these optional rules are not in effect, buckler shield armor points are added to the armor of the arm (with armor in excess of what that arm can legally carry, discarded). Binder shields are treated as Tower shields.

## SHIELD TYPES

| Name       | Placement              | Properties                                                                 |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Buckler\*   | Upper arm slot 5 or 6  | • Protects arm (all hits)<br>• Protects head (side hits)<br>• Not droppable |
| Binder     | Lower arm slot 5 or 6  | • Can be used to stow rifles<br>• Protects arm (all hits)<br>• Can protect closest torso<br>• Not droppable |
| Tower      | Hand Actuator only     | • Protects arm (all hits)<br>• Can protect closest torso<br>• Can protect closest torso and center torso<br>• Droppable |

\* A good example of a 'Mech already equipped with buckler shields is the *Griffin*. Note that the buckler protrudes high above the top surface of the shoulder. Therefore 'Mechs such as the *Shadow Hawk*, *Battlemaster*, and *Wolverine* which appear to have buckler-like armor pieces on their arms, do not technically carry bucklers.
