# A/C AND MISSILE RULES

by Nicholas Gendron

## INTRODUCTION

BATTLETECH is a great SF game, but like any other game it isn't entirely flawless. We will look at two points which tend to hurt our sense of realism and give new rules to try to correct them. We will first talk about the explosive-type weapons, mainly the AutoCannons (identified hereby as AC) and then both type of missiles, the SRM and the LRM.

## AUTOCANNONS

AC are giant-sized machine guns firing depleted uranium shells. The caliber varies between 40 and 120 mm, with the rate of fire varying according to the caliber of the weapon. The ammunition for the gun can be stored in the 'Mech in what we call magazines. Each magazine contains enough ammunition for one burst, but the empty magazine is swept away and replaced by a new one; this goes on until all ammunition is spent. In the game, ACs are classified by the damage they inflict. There are four types of ACs; here is a short description of each:

**AC/2**: The lightest of them all. This AC type is known for its long range capability but its lack of firepower makes this weapon useful only against lightly armored targets. The caliber ranges from 40 to 55 mm.

**AC/5**: One of the most popular ACs throughout the Inner Sphere. It can be of almost any caliber: from 60 to 120 mm (depending on the model) with a different rate of fire for each caliber. Its weight/damage ratio is poor (in game terms you cause 5 points of damage for a gun weighing 8 tons without ammo).

**AC/10**: The AC/10 is an intermediate class weapon. It combines good range with fair firepower. Like the AC/5, the AC/10 covers a lot of calibers, all in the same weight category. Like every other AC, the main drawback is weight, around 12 tons without ammo.

**AC/20**: When you talk about the AC/20, you talk about heavy firepower but very short range (maximum range of 270 meters). Due to its weight (14 tons+ammo), this weapon is mainly used on assault-class 'Mechs, but it is sometimes found on smaller ones.

At first, these weapons don't look so bad. But the AC design suffers from several problems. First, weight: the lightest AC weighs 6 tons and the heaviest has a mass of 14 tons, all this without ammunition. 

The second main trouble is ammo: the AC cannot plug itself into the 'Mech's fusion reactor and function almost indefinitely like the energy weapons. The ammunition not only takes space and tonnage, it also has the bad habit of running out in the middle of a fight; there is also the risk of an ammunition explosion. A direct hit, a little bad luck, and you're dead. Ammo explosion can be deadly...

On the other hand, there is a good side to the AC family: the heat output is low compared to other guns. The heat/damage ratio is good (or at least acceptable) for the AC/10 and the AC/20, but the AC/2 and AC/5 have miserable ratios. That's why we changed the rules for those two weapons.

## NEW RULE FOR THE AC

This rule changes the number of shots an AC/2 and an AC/5 can fire in one turn. All types of ACs are in fact large-sized machine guns with high rates of fire. This is why we considered that the smallest ACs should be able to fire more often.

The AC/2 can now fire 3 times per turn; each turn the gun is used the player must specify how many times the gun fires. Of course each time the gun fires, it uses one magazine (one ammo point) and produces the according heat. Since those weapons are machines guns, the chance of jamming is almost nonexistent. For simplicity's sake, we will assume they cannot jam.

When you fire an AC/2 more than once in a turn, all shots are played out with the normal rule of "to hit" roll, but the second shot has a +1 modifier and the third shot a +2 modifier. Each shot is rolled to see if it hits the target, so an AC/2 firing three times must make three different rolls. [Fix this]

For the AC/5, the same rule applies except that the AC/5 can only fire twice per turn. There is a +1 modifier to the second shot and each shot rolls to hit separtely. So when firing an AC/5 twice in the same turn, you make two "to hit" rolls, with two locations to damage. You also use two of your ammo points and produce two points of heat, but you have caused ten points of damage, assuming that both shots hit.

You can use the new rule with the Ultra ACs, following the new procedure in both single and double mode (for double mode rules, check the BTech Compendum). The only difference is when firing in double mode more than once: you then do two location rolls for each shot as normal, but use the following procedure. The first round uses the standard hit location table, but for the second, you use the first shot as a guide. 

If the first round hits the legs of the “Mech”, it’s safe to assume that the second round will hit close to it, since both shots are fired almost simultaneously. So when the first round hits the legs, use the kick hit location table for the second round. If you hit an arm or a torso with the first round, use the punch hit location table for the second. The rule regarding the possibility of weapon jamming is still used but now a rool of 2 or 3 on the "to hit" roll will block the loading mechanism. Remember, the firing rate is so high, the more you shoot, the higher the chance of jamming.

## MISSILES

Like the autocannons, missiles are direct descendants of the ones used in the 20th century. In the BATTLETECH world, the missiles are divided into two types, the short and long range. The main reason for this limited number of missile type is to keep the game fast moving and simple. The SRM and the LRM (abbreviations of Short Range Missile and Long Range Missile) are basically the same in design, the only difference being the size of the propulsion unit and the type of warhead. The SRM has a small propulsion unit and a heavy warhead, while the LRM has more fuel (for long range) and a smaller warhead.

At most missiles measure approximately one meter in length with a diameter of 0.20 meter. Even with this size, a 'Mech cannot carry hundreds of missiles. So how do you explain the fact an Archer carries 480 missiles? That a BattleMaster, even with its huge size, carries 180 missiles? We could go on with examples of this kind, but this is not the only problem: how do you make a missile go from the torso to the launcher, when this launcher is in the arm? At first it seems to be easy, but how can you make the missile pass the shoulder and elbow articulations (bend it)? This is why we revised the rules concerning missiles.

## NEW RULES FOR MISSILES

The rules concerning the "to hit" procedure are the same. The only difference is that the standard rules applies to the damage that each type of missile inflicts and of course the number of rockets carried by the 'Mech. Let's begin with the number of missiles carried in the launcher. The new rule implies that each launcher carries only one shot. We mean that an SRM 6 carries 6 missiles, a LRM 20 carries 20 missiles and so on. The only exception is the 'Mech carrying two tons of ammunition instead of one ton, like the Archer who now carries 40 missiles per launcher instead of 20. 

The other difference is in the damage they cause. From now on a single SRM missile will inflict 12 points of damage and the LRM will inflict 6 points of damage per missile. With the new rule for damage, the firing system is modified. Now you do not have to fire all your missiles at once. You can fire one missile at a time or any even number of missiles (of course the old table originally used for the LRM 5 and the LRM 15 is still good). For example, a LRM 10 can fire one, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10 missiles at once. At the end of this article there's a table for missile hits that's compatible with these new rules.

When designing a 'Mech you can't carry more than two tons of ammunition per launcher (this is valid for Inner Sphere 'Mechs). In the Clan 'Mechs, due to their advanced technology, the missiles are smaller so they can carry more of them. When constructing an OmniMech you can carry up to 3 tons of missile per launcher.

The one-shot launcher is a special type of launcher. The OS (One Shot) launcher is a "fire and forget" type of weapon: once it's fired you have to replace it. The advantage is that you don't have to expend any internal ammunition slot to carry it. OS launchers come in any type of SRM and LRM, with the same range as a regular type. But due to the smaller size of the missiles, they cause less damage. The ammunition of an OS SRM does 4 points of damage and the ammunition of the OS LRM inflicts 2 points of damage. Also, the OS launcher has to fire all of its missiles at the same time, just as in the old rules. 

The SWARM and STREAK missile types can be used with these new rules, but for the moment the THUNDER LRM missile will be left out. Heat is produced by missiles and not by launchers. Whatever the type, SRM or LRM, each missile causes one heat point when it is launched. For example, if you fire all twenty missiles of your LRM 20 in one turn, it produces 20 damage points but it also inflicts a maximum of 120 damage points! OS missiles cost less in heat: they produce double the old amount for a launcher of their type (ex. 2X6 points for an OS LRM 20).

With these new rules, we hope that our BATTLETECH game will be more realistic. We still believe it to be far more deadly, so you'd better watch those lights carrying lots of SRM...
